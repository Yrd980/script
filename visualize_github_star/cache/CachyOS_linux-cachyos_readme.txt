Our kernels feature multiple CPU schedulers, advanced compiler optimizations, and carefully selected patches to deliver better responsiveness and throughput. > !NOTE > All CachyOS kernels are available in multiple architecture optimizations: , , , and . The default kernel is compiled with GCC due a bug at the NVIDIA Driver. Kernel Variants & Schedulers Each scheduler is optimized for different use cases. We recommend testing each one to find the best fit for your specific requirements. Available Schedulers - BORE - Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer - Packages: , - Best for: Interactive workloads and gaming - Developer: firelzrd - EEVDF - Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First - Package: - Best for: General-purpose computing with fair scheduling - BMQ - BitMap Queue CPU Scheduler - Package: - Developer: Alfred Chen Specialized Variants - - Security-focused kernel with hardening patches - - Long Term Support version for stability - - Real-time kernel with BORE scheduler - - Server-optimized configuration - - Steam Deck optimized variant Compiler Variants - - Default GCC-compiled kernel with Thin LTO - - Clang and Thin LTO, utilizing AutoFDO + Propeller profiling for optimal performance. > !TIP > For detailed explanations of each kernel variant, visit our Kernel Wiki.

CachyOS Repositories Our repositories contain optimized Arch Linux and CachyOS packages rebuilt with performance, stability, and security enhancements. Available Repository Tiers | Repository | Target CPUs | Package Coverage | Optimization Level | |------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------| | | AMD Zen 4 & Zen 5 | Full package set | Zen4-specific optimizations | | | Intel Xeon / Intel 11th | Full package set | AVX, AVX2, AVX512, SSE4.2, SSSE3 | | | 2012 or newer | Full package set | AVX, AVX2, SSE4.2, SSSE3 | | | All x86-64 CPUs | Kernels only | Basic optimizations | Quick Installation Automated Setup Recommended Our installation script automatically detects your CPU and configures the optimal repositories: What the script does: - Auto-detects your CPU architecture support - Configures appropriate repository tiers - Backs up your existing - Sets up GPG keys and mirrors For more information, visit our GitHub or join our Discord community. Manual Installation Step 1: Add CachyOS Signing Keys Step 2: Install Required Packages > !CAUTION > About CachyOS Pacman: This installs a forked version of pacman with CachyOS-specific features like tracking and automatic architecture detection. While this provides enhanced functionality, it may cause compatibility warnings with standard Arch Linux workflows. > > Alternative: If you prefer to avoid the custom pacman, skip the repository and only use the optimized package repositories , , , etc.. Rollback Instructions If you need to revert to standard Arch repositories after using CachyOS pacman: CPU Compatibility Check Before manually configuring repositories, verify your CPU's instruction set support. > !NOTE > Skip this step if using the automated installation script—it handles detection automatically. Check Your CPU Support Understanding the Output Look for the indicators: - ✅ = CPU supports v4 instruction set - ❌ without parentheses = CPU does NOT support v4 Example Output for Compatible CPU: Instruction Set Requirements: - x86-64-v4: Intel Haswell 2013+ / AMD Excavator 2015+ - x86-64-v3: Intel Nehalem 2008+ / AMD Bulldozer 2011+ - x86-64-v2: Intel Core 2 2006+ / AMD K8 2003+ Repository Configuration Edit your pacman configuration to add the appropriate repositories: For x86-64 Basic Support: For x86-64-v3 Support: For x86-64-v4 Support: For AMD Zen4 CPUs: Finalize Installation: 🎉 Congratulations! Your system is now optimized with CachyOS packages. Debug Packages Debug symbols are available through debuginfod. Configure it by creating: Uninstalling CachyOS Repositories For complete removal instructions, see our Uninstallation Guide. SCX Schedulers CachyOS supports the new sched-ext SCX framework for userspace schedulers. For setup and configuration, see our sched-ext Tutorial. > !WARNING > SCX schedulers are not compatible with the kernel variant.
