Rofi emoji plugin An emoji selector plugin for Rofi that copies the selected emoji to the clipboard, among other things. > !Note > See the branchstable-branch for documentation of 3.x branch, > which is the version that is meant for Rofi ‚â§ 1.7.5. Screenshots !Screenshot showing a Rofi window searching for emojis containing "uni", the emoji for "Unicorn face" being selected !Screenshot of the Emoji menu for the Unicorn emoji Usage Run Rofi like: Keybindings | Keymap | Default key in Rofi | Effect | | ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | | | <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Select emoji see Mode below. | | | <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> | Opens a menu for the Emoji with other actions. | | | <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> | Copy emoji. | > üí° Tip: Change your to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. > > Search patterns You can type parts of the Emojis name or keywords to find it. If you want to limit your search to particular groups or subgroups you can use prefix searches: - - Limit to emojis that have inside of its Group, like . !screenshots/groupsearch.png - - Limit to emojis that have inside of its Subgroup, e.g. . !screenshots/subgroupsearch1.png !screenshots/subgroupsearch2.png You can only use one instance inside of each prefix. The latest one wins: - - Searches for on all emojis in a group including . If you want to know which group and subgroup a particular emoji has, you can open the menu on it. See Menu below. Menu By pressing the binding on an emoji the plugin will open a menu for that particular emoji. The menu will provide you with alternative actions, like copying the Emojis name or codepoint. Metadata about the emoji will also be shown inside the menu in case you want to know what group it belongs to in order to find it faster in the future. Command line arguments Due to a limitation in Rofi's plugin system, this plugin cannot append additional options to the output of . The plugin adds the following command line arguments to : | Name | Description | | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | | | Default action when selecting an emoji in the search. | | | Path to custom emoji database file. | | | Custom formatting string for rendering lines. See below. | Mode The plugin supports five modes: 1. default - Copies the selected emoji, and then tries to insert it directly in the focused window. 2. - Only copies the selected emoji to your clipboard without trying to insert anything. 3. - Tries to insert the emoji in the focused window, but without copying anything. 4. - Open the menu. Useful if you prefer to always get options when just pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. 5. - Write selected emoji to standard output. This is useful if you want to use the emoji selector inside of a shell pipeline, like Rofi's mode. It will use the argument to customize the outputted text, just like . Inserting is not very reliable under X11 since different toolkits respond differently to the X11 events that are emitted when trying to write unicode characters. If inserting does not work for you, you can still paste the emoji as before. In case you have any issues with insertion mode, you can override the default mode using a command line argument to Rofi. The mode is also always available on . Format The formatting string should be valid Pango markuppango with placeholders for the Emoji values found in the database. The logic of this follows the same rule as Rofi's option, quickly summarized as such: - Items between curly braces are replaced with Pangopango-escaped text. - Wrapping an item inside brackets will hide the entire section if the value is empty. The default format string is this: This will render the emoji with its name next to it in bold, and if the emoji has any keywords they will be shown in a parenthesised list with a smaller font size. | Item | Example | | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | ü§£ | | | Rolling on the floor laughing | | | Smileys & Emotion | | | Face-smiling | | | Face, Floor, Laugh, Rofl, Rolling, Rolling on the floor laughing, Rotfl | | | U+1F923 | | | | | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: | Rofi does not have a way to escape brackets, so you may not use literal inside your output. | Example !screenshots/customformat.png Dependencies | rofi-emoji version | Rofi version | | -------------------: | -----------: | | 3.xstable-branch | ‚â§ 1.7.5 | | 4.xmaster-branch | ‚â• 1.7.6 | Optional dependencies In order to actually use rofi-emoji an "adapter" need to be installed, as appropriate for your environment. | Kind | Dependency | Environment | | ------ | ------------ | ----------- | | Copy | xsel | X11 | | Copy | xclip | X11 | | Copy | copyq | X11 | | Copy | wl-clipboard | Wayland | | | | | | Insert | xdotool | X11 | | Insert | wtype | Wayland | You only need to install the ones required for your environment and usage. Note that in order to use mode you must also install a adapter as also copies as a fallback. Installation <a href="https://repology.org/metapackage/rofi-emoji/versions"> <img src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/rofi-emoji.svg" alt="Packaging status" align="right"> </a> Arch Linux There's also a community-managed AUR package called https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rofi-emoji-git. Manjaro Void Linux NixOS or Home Manager If you are using you should set up this as a plugin to your Rofi install: If you are using plain NixOS, then you might need to set up your own plugin path to the command. Compile from source uses autotools as its build system. On Debian/Ubuntu based systems you will need to install the packages first: - - - - - Download the source and run the following to install it: If you plan on developing the code and want to test the plugin, you can also run , which will do all setup steps for you and then start Rofi using the locally compiled plugin and clipboard adapter script. This will not affect your system and does not require root. > !Note > Don't forget to also install the appropriate optional > dependencies in order for the plugin to work. Running tests Also install and run the following commands after doing the Compile from source steps above. There is not a lot of things to test here since Rofi doesn't expose any of its internal methods as a library to link the test binaries against, which means it's not possible to compile and link any tests for any files where a Rofi dependency is used. Emoji database When installing, the emoji database is installed in . The plugin will search for a directory where exists in if no option is set. If the plugin cannot find the file, make sure is set correctly. If it is unset it should default to , which works with the most common prefixes. Custom database The emoji database is a plain-text file that lists one emoji per line. It has the following format: Example rows: Updating default database to a newer version The list is copied from the Mange/emoji-dataemoji-data repo.
