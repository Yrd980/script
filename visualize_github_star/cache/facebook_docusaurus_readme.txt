Short on time? Check out our 5-minute tutorial ‚è±Ô∏è! Tip: use docusaurus.new to test Docusaurus immediately in a playground. - Simple to Start > Docusaurus is built in a way so that it can get running in as little time as possible. We've built Docusaurus to handle the website build process so you can focus on your project. - Localizable > Docusaurus ships with localization support via CrowdIn. Empower and grow your international community by translating your documentation. - Customizable > While Docusaurus ships with the key pages and sections you need to get started, including a home page, a docs section, a blog, and additional support pages, it is also customizable as well to ensure you have a site that is uniquely yours. Installation Use the initialization CLI to create your site: Read the docs for any further information. Contributing We've released Docusaurus because it helps us better scale and supports the many OSS projects at Meta. We hope that other organizations can benefit from the project. We are thankful for any contributions from the community. Code of Conduct Meta has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.
