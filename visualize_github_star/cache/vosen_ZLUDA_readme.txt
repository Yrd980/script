!Discordhttps://discord.gg/sg6BNzXuc7 ZLUDA ZLUDA is a drop-in replacement for CUDA on non-NVIDIA GPUs. ZLUDA allows running unmodified CUDA applications using non-NVIDIA GPUs with near-native performance. ZLUDA supports AMD Radeon RX 5000 series and newer GPUs both desktop and integrated. !GeekBench 5.5.1 chart ZLUDA is a work in progress. Follow development here and say hi on Discord. For more details, see the announcement: https://vosen.github.io/ZLUDA/blog/zludas-third-life/ Usage Warning: This version ZLUDA is under heavy development more here and right now only supports Geekbench. ZLUDA probably will not work with your application just yet. Windows You should have a recent AMD GPU driver "AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition" installed.\ To run your application, you should either: Recommended approach Copy ZLUDA-provided and from if built from sources or if downloaded a zip package into a path which your application uses to load CUDA. Paths vary application to application, but usually it's the directory where the .exe file is located Use ZLUDA launcher like below. ZLUDA launcher is known to be buggy and incomplete: Linux Run your application like this: where is the directory which contains ZLUDA-provided : if you built from sources or if you downloaded a prebuilt package. MacOS Not supported Building Dependencies Git CMake Python 3 Rust compiler recent version C++ compiler Optional, but recommended Ninja build system Build steps Git clone the repo make sure to use option to fetch submodules: Enter freshly cloned directory and build with cargo this takes a while: Contributing ZLUDA project has a commercial backing and does not accept donations. ZLUDA project accepts pull requests and other non-monetary contributions. If you want to contribute a code fix or documentation update, feel free to open a Pull Request. Getting started There's no architecture document yet. The two most important crates in ZLUDA are PTX compiler and AMD GPU runtime. A good starting point to tinkering with the project is to run one of the unit tests under a debugger and understand what it is doing. is a simple test that adds two numbers. Github issues tagged with "help wanted" are tasks that are self-contained. Their level of difficulty varies, and they are not always good beginner tasks, but they are defined unambiguously.
