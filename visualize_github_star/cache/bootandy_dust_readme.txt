!Build Statushttps://github.com/bootandy/dust/actions Dust du + rust = dust. Like du but more intuitive. Why Because I want an easy way to see where my disk is being used.

Dust will print a maximum of one 'Did not have permissions message'. Dust will list a slightly-less-than-the-terminal-height number of the biggest subdirectories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree to find the larger ones. There is no need for a '-d' flag or a '-h' flag. The largest subdirectories will be colored. The different colors on the bars: These represent the combined tree hierarchy & disk usage. The shades of grey are used to indicate which parent folder a subfolder belongs to. For instance, look at the above screenshot. is a folder taking 44% of the space. From the bar is a light grey line that goes up. All these folders are inside so if you delete all that stuff will be gone too. Usage Config file Dust has a config file where the above options can be set. Either: or Alternatives - NCDU - dutree - dua - pdu - dirstat-rs - du -d 1 -h | sort -h Note: Apparent-size is calculated slightly differently in dust to gdu. In dust each hard link is counted as using filelength space. In gdu only the first entry is counted.
