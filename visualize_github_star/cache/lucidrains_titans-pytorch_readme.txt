Will also contain some explorations into architectures beyond their simple 1-4 layer MLP for the neural memory module, if it works well to any degree. Appreciation - Eryk for sharing his early experimental results with me, positive for 2 layer MLP Install Usage A transformer with the configuration can be used as Experiments Then modify and run it to query nature Citations
