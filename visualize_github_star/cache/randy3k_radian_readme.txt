One would consider radian as a ipython clone for R, though its design is more aligned to julia. <img width="600px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1690993/30728530-b5e9eb5c-9f26-11e7-8453-73a2e880c9de.png"></img> Features - cross platform, runs on Windows, macOS and Linux - shell mode: hit to enter and to leave - reticulate python repl mode: hit to enter - improved R prompt and reticulate python prompt - multiline editing - syntax highlight - auto completion reticulate autocompletion depends on - unicode support - latex completion - auto matching parens/quotes. - bracketed paste mode - emacs/vi editing mode - automatically adjust to terminal width - read more than 4096 bytes per line Installation Requirements: - An installation of R version 3.4.0 or above is required to use radian, an R installation binary for your system can be downloaded from <https://cran.r-project.org>. - version 3.8 or above is also required to install radian. If your system doesn't come with a python distribution, it can be downloaded from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>. - Installing via https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/ would be the easiest option. Alias on unix system You could alias to radian by putting in such that would open radian and would still open the traditional R console. is still useful, e.g, running . Settings radian can be customized by specifying the below options in various locations - or Unix - Windows - Unix - Windows - in the working directory The options could be also specified in the files, however, it is not recommended because 1. the settings are not persistent when vanilla mode is used; 2. it doesn't work well with or . Custom key bindings FAQ Unicode doesn't work in Windows and R 4.2+ The latest version of R supports Unicode codepage directly. However, radian relies on Python and Python doesn't support Unicode in the way that R supports it. A workaround could be found here: <https://github.com/randy3k/radian/issues/269issuecomment-1169663251>. Though it may break the ploting device running will kill radian. I can't specify python runtime in reticulate It is expected. runs on python and the python runtime used by radian is forced in reticulate. gives the note: In order to use radian with another python runtime, you will need to install on that python environment. How to switch to a different R or specify the version of R There are serveral options. - The easiest option is to pass the path to the R binary with , i.e., - Also, one could expose the path to the R binary in the variable - The environment variable could also be used to specify the path to R. - The environment variable could also be used to specify R home directory. Note that it is should be set as the result of , not the directory where is located. For example, in Unix Cannot find shared library Please also make sure that R was installed with the R shared library or or . On Linux, the configure flag may be needed to install R from the source. Do not forget to to force the recompilation of the files with the correct compiler options. Outdated setuptools If you encounter > The package setup script has attempted to modify files on your system that are not within the EasyInstall build area. Please update your setuptools by How to use local history file radian maintains its own history file and doesn't use the file. A local is used if it is found in the launch directory. Otherwise, the global history file would be used. To override the default behavior, you could launch radian with the options: , or . Does it slow down my R program? radian only provides a frontend to the R program, the actual running eventloop is the same as that of the traditional R console. There is no performance sacrifice or gain while using this modern command line interface. However, it was reported that radian may be slower when using parallel computation, specifially when using forking. User should take extra care in those cases. Nvim-R support Put in your vim config. Auto Completions To enable reticulate prompt completions, make sure that is installed. Alternatively, if you use conda, Prompt not shown inside a docker container It maybe caused by the invalid terminal size, try running in your terminal to see if it returns a correct size. You could change the values of it from the environmental variables and when you log-in the docker container. Why called radian? radian is powered by Ï€thon.
