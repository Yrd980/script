It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points‚Äîvectors with an additional payload Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications. Qdrant is written in Rust ü¶Ä, which makes it fast and reliable even under high load. See benchmarks. With Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more! Qdrant is also available as a fully managed Qdrant Cloud ‚õÖ including a free tier. <p align="center"> <strong><a href="docs/QUICKSTART.md">Quick Start</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="clients">Client Libraries</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="demo-projects">Demo Projects</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="integrations">Integrations</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="contacts">Contact</a> </strong> </p> Getting Started Python The python client offers a convenient way to start with Qdrant locally: Client-Server To experience the full power of Qdrant locally, run the container with this command: Now you can connect to this with any client, including Python: Before deploying Qdrant to production, be sure to read our installation and security guides.

Deploy a neural search in minutes using a pre-trained neural network, and experience the future of text search. Try it online! Explore Similar Image Search - Food Discovery üçï There's more to discovery than text search, especially when it comes to food. People often choose meals based on appearance rather than descriptions and ingredients. Let Qdrant help your users find their next delicious meal using visual search, even if they don't know the dish's name. Check it out! Master Extreme Classification - E-commerce Product Categorization üì∫ Enter the cutting-edge realm of extreme classification, an emerging machine learning field tackling multi-class and multi-label problems with millions of labels. Harness the potential of similarity learning models, and see how a pre-trained transformer model and Qdrant can revolutionize e-commerce product categorization.

OpenAPI makes it easy to generate a client for virtually any framework or programming language. You can also download raw OpenAPI definitions. gRPC For faster production-tier searches, Qdrant also provides a gRPC interface. You can find gRPC documentation here. Features Filtering and Payload Qdrant can attach any JSON payloads to vectors, allowing for both the storage and filtering of data based on the values in these payloads. Payload supports a wide range of data types and query conditions, including keyword matching, full-text filtering, numerical ranges, geo-locations, and more. Filtering conditions can be combined in various ways, including , , and clauses, ensuring that you can implement any desired business logic on top of similarity matching. Hybrid Search with Sparse Vectors To address the limitations of vector embeddings when searching for specific keywords, Qdrant introduces support for sparse vectors in addition to the regular dense ones. Sparse vectors can be viewed as an generalization of BM25 or TF-IDF ranking. They enable you to harness the capabilities of transformer-based neural networks to weigh individual tokens effectively. Vector Quantization and On-Disk Storage Qdrant provides multiple options to make vector search cheaper and more resource-efficient. Built-in vector quantization reduces RAM usage by up to 97% and dynamically manages the trade-off between search speed and precision. Distributed Deployment Qdrant offers comprehensive horizontal scaling support through two key mechanisms: 1. Size expansion via sharding and throughput enhancement via replication 2. Zero-downtime rolling updates and seamless dynamic scaling of the collections Highlighted Features Query Planning and Payload Indexes - leverages stored payload information to optimize query execution strategy. SIMD Hardware Acceleration - utilizes modern CPU x86-x64 and Neon architectures to deliver better performance. Async I/O - uses to maximize disk throughput utilization even on a network-attached storage. Write-Ahead Logging - ensures data persistence with update confirmation, even during power outages.
