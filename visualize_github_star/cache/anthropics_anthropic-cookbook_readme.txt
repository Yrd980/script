Anthropic Cookbook The Anthropic Cookbook provides code and guides designed to help developers build with Claude, offering copy-able code snippets that you can easily integrate into your own projects. Prerequisites To make the most of the examples in this cookbook, you'll need an Anthropic API key sign up for free here. While the code examples are primarily written in Python, the concepts can be adapted to any programming language that supports interaction with the Anthropic API. If you're new to working with the Anthropic API, we recommend starting with our Anthropic API Fundamentals course to get a solid foundation.
