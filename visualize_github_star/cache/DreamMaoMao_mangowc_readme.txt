Lightweight & Fast Build - Mango is as lightweight as dwl, and can be built completely within a few seconds. Despite this, Mango does not compromise on functionality. 2. Feature Highlights - In addition to basic WM functionality, Mango provides: - Excellent xwayland support. - Base tags not workspaces supports separate window layouts for each tag - Smooth and customizable complete animations window open/move/close, tag enter/leave,layer open/close/move - Excellent input method support text input v2/v3 - Flexible window layouts with easy switching scroller, master, monocle, spiral, etc. - Rich window states swallow, minimize, maximize, unglobal, global, fakefullscreen, overlay, etc. - Simple yet powerful external configuration - Sway-like scratchpad and named scratchpad - Minimize window to scratchpad - Hycov-like overview - Window effects from scenefx blur, shadow, corner radius, opacity 3. Some disadvantages - Since it uses the fully automatic layout like dwm style, it does not allow you to manually adjust the window size when the window is in tiled state. It only allows you to change the layout parameters to adjust the window ratio.

First, add GURU repository: Then, add and to the . Finally, install the package: Patching wlroots is done by getting the patch with git from the repository and then copying it to .

Use the NixOS module to install mango with other necessary components of a working Wayland environment. Use the home-manager module to declare configuration and autostart for mango. Here's an example of using the modules in a flake: Packaging mango To package mango for other distributions, you can check the reference setup for: - nix - arch. - gentoo Currently building mango requires a patched version of . If possible, the patch can be extracted from the latest commit and applied on step. If it is not possible, you will need to create a separate package and make it a build dependency. You might also need to package for your distribution, check availability here. If you encounter build errors when packaging , feel free to create an issue and ask a question, but Read The Friendly Manual on packaging software in your distribution first.
