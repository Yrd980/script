Espressif Advanced Development Framework !Documentation Statushttps://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-adf/en/latest/?badge=latest Espressif Systems Advanced Development Framework ESP-ADF is the official Advanced Development Framework for the ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6, ESP32-S3, and ESP32-P4 SoCs. Overview ESP-ADF supports development of audio applications for the Espressif Systems SoCs in the most comprehensive way. With ESP-ADF, you can easily add features, develop audio and video applications from simple to complex: - Music player or recorder supports audio formats such as MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, OGG, OPUS, AMR, TS, EQ, Downmixer, Sonic, ALC, G.711 and etc. - Play music from sources: HTTP, HLS HTTP Live Streaming, SPIFFS, SDCARD, A2DP-Source, A2DP-Sink, HFP and etc. - Integrate media protocols, such as: DLNA, VoIP, RMTP, ESP-RTC SIP, RTSP, and RTCP, etc. - Video call, video recording and video live streaming - Internet Radio - Voice recognition and integration with online services such as Alexa, DuerOS and etc. As a general, the ESP-ADF features will be supported as shown below: <div align="center"><img src="docs/static/adfblockdiagram.png" alt ="ADF Block Diagram" align="center" /></div> Developing with the ESP-ADF IDF Version The following table shows the ESP-IDF versions supported by ESP-ADF at the current time. The label !alt text means supported, and the label !alt text means not supported. The ESP-IDF master branch is marked as not supported because the major feature changes it has introduced may cause conflicts with ESP-ADF. Yet, the ADF examples not affected by those feature changes can still run correctly on the IDF master branch. End of Life IDF branches are removed. See IDF Supported Periods for details. | | ESP-IDF <br> Release/v5.0 | ESP-IDF <br> Release/v5.1 | ESP-IDF <br> Release/v5.2 | ESP-IDF <br> Release/v5.3 | ESP-IDF <br> Master | |:----------- | :---------------------:|:---------------------: | :---------------------:| :---------------------:| :---------------------:| | ESP-ADF <br> Master | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text | | ESP-ADF <br> Release/v2.7 | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text | | ESP-ADF <br> Release/v2.6 | !alt text| !alt text |!alt text | !alt text | !alt text | Quick Start You need one of ESP-IDF versions described in ESP-ADF Releases, one of audio boards below and headphones. Note: If this is your first exposure to ESP-IDF, proceed to Getting Started documentation specific for ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 or ESP32-P4 SoCs. Click on one of the audio boards shown below to set up and use the ESP-ADF getting-started guide. Hardware Espressif Systems has released a number of boards for ESP-ADF to develop audio applications. Click the links below to learn more information on each board. It is recommended to use the ESP-ADF master branch, as it has the latest bugfixes and the new features. | | ESP32-LyraT-Mini |ESP32-S3-Korvo-2|ESP32-C3-Lyra| ESP32-S3-Box Series| ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board| |:----------- | :---------------------:| :---------------------:| :---------------------:| :---------------------:| :---------------------:| | | <img src="docs/static/esp32-lyrat-mini-v1.2.png" width="110" alt ="ESP32-LyraT-Mini Development Board" align="center" /> | <img src="docs/static/esp32-s3-korvo-2-v3.0-overview.png" width="120" alt ="ESP32-S3-Korvo-2 Development Board" align="center" /> | <img src="docs/static/esp32-c3-lyra-v2.0-small.png" width="120" alt ="ESP32-C3-Lyra Development Board" align="center" /> | <img src="docs/static/esp32s3box3.jpg" width="100" alt ="ESP32-S3-Box Development Board" align="center" /> | <img src="docs/static/esp32-p4-function-ev-board.jpg" width="100" alt ="" align="center" /> | | ESP-ADF Master | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text <sup> 1 </sup> | !alt text | | ESP-ADF Release/v2.7 | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text <sup> 1 </sup> | !alt text | | ESP-ADF Release/v2.6 | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text | !alt text <sup> 1 </sup> | !alt text | Note 1: For the development board of esp-box series, only esp32-s3-box and esp32-s3-box-lite are supported in ESP-ADF.
