Start here! 1. All beginners should start with one of the guides below the top two are the best in my personal opinion. - Starter's Guide - From /r/learnjapanese subreddit. - DJT guide - A well-written guide. - Japanese Walkthrough - A visual learning guide. - Grammar Guide to Japanese - By Tae Kim Note: Tae Kim also has a "Complete Guide to Japanese", which is a work in progress. - The Moe Way - A Japanese guide outlining the fundamentals as well as guides on setting up various language acquisition software tools such as visual novel text hooks. 2. A summary of the guides is basically this: first, learn hiragana and katakana using the links in Hiragana/Katakana section further down this page. The Tofugu links are a good starting place. 3. Next is grammar/vocabulary. You can either use a structured textbook or a more free-form online grammar guide like Tae Kim. Either one works, try one or both and stick with the one you like the best. For vocabulary, three nice options are Wanikani, Memrise, and Anki. If you go with the Anki route, consider using this deck, which is the same as the deck in the above link, but with the front and back flipped around to display sentences on the front rather than single words, as this will force you to learn words in context. For translation, try to avoid Google Translate. Instead choose one from the Dictionary list. 4. That's it. There are many, many paths to learning Japanese. The most important thing is to choose the one you enjoy. If you don't enjoy your study, you won't succeed, so keep searching until you find the resource or study method that you enjoy. Look through all the resources below, ask someone if you need help, and good luck. Textbook Textbooks provide you with structured learning material. Genki :baby: Everyone's favorite Japanese textbook. Recommended for beginners.
