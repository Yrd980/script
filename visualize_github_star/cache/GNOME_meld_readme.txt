About Meld ========== Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers. Meld helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled projects. It provides two- and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and supports many version control systems including Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, CVS and Subversion. Meld helps you review code changes, understand patches, and makes enormous merge conflicts slightly less painful. Meld is licensed under the GPL v2 or later.
