Security keys are external devices that can be used for signing in on websites. You can see OpenSK in action in this video on YouTube! We intend to bring a full open source experience to security keys, from application to operating system. You can even 3D print your own open source enclosure! <img src="docs/img/enclosure.jpg" alt="OpenSK Enclosure" width="200"/> You can run OpenSK: - as a Wasefire applet, - as a Tock OS application, or - as a library. You are viewing the branch for developers. New features are developed here. Go to the default branch for a more stable version of OpenSK. FIDO2 OpenSK's version that implemented CTAP 2.0 was certified by the FIDO Alliance. The develop branch tracks the latest release version of the CTAP specification. This branch is not FIDO certified. OpenSK supports U2F, and non-discoverable credentials created with either protocol are compatible with the other. :warning: Disclaimer This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is proof-of-concept and a research platform. It is NOT meant for a daily usage. This branch is under development, and therefore less rigorously tested than the numbered branches. We're still in the process of integrating the ARM&reg; CryptoCell-310 embedded in the Nordic nRF52840 chip to enable hardware-accelerated cryptography. In the meantime, we use RustCrypto. Hardware You will need one the following supported boards: Nordic nRF52840-DK development kit. This board is more convenient for development and debug scenarios as the JTAG probe is already on the board. Nordic nRF52840 Dongle to have a more practical form factor. Makerdiary nRF52840-MDK USB dongle. Feitian OpenSK dongle. Installation To install OpenSK, 1. follow the general setup steps, 1. then continue with the instructions for your specific hardware: Nordic nRF52840-DK Nordic nRF52840 Dongle Makerdiary nRF52840-MDK USB dongle Feitian OpenSK dongle To test whether the installation was successful, visit a demo website and try to register and login. Please check our Troubleshooting and Debugging section if you have problems with the installation process or during development. To find out what else you can do with your OpenSK, see Customization. Research We implemented post-quantum cryptography on OpenSK. The code is released under the hybrid-pqc tag. Our paper was published in the ACNS Secure Cryptographic Implementation workshop 2023 and won the best paper award. <details> <summary>Bibtex reference</summary> </details> Contributing See Contributing.md.
