!header AlphaFold 3 This package provides an implementation of the inference pipeline of AlphaFold 3. See below for how to access the model parameters. You may only use AlphaFold 3 model parameters if received directly from Google. Use is subject to these terms of use. Any publication that discloses findings arising from using this source code, the model parameters or outputs produced by those should cite the Accurate structure prediction of biomolecular interactions with AlphaFold 3 paper. Please also refer to the Supplementary Information for a detailed description of the method. AlphaFold 3 is also available at alphafoldserver.com for non-commercial use, though with a more limited set of ligands and covalent modifications. If you have any questions, please contact the AlphaFold team at alphafold@google.com. Obtaining Model Parameters This repository contains all necessary code for AlphaFold 3 inference. To request access to the AlphaFold 3 model parameters, please complete this form. Access will be granted at Google DeepMind’s sole discretion. We will aim to respond to requests within 2–3 business days. You may only use AlphaFold 3 model parameters if received directly from Google. Use is subject to these terms of use. Installation and Running Your First Prediction See the installation documentation. Once you have installed AlphaFold 3, you can test your setup using e.g. the following input JSON file named : You can then run AlphaFold 3 using the following command: There are various flags that you can pass to the command, to list them all run . Two fundamental flags that control which parts AlphaFold 3 will run are: defaults to : whether to run the data pipeline, i.e. genetic and template search. This part is CPU-only, time consuming and could be run on a machine without a GPU. defaults to : whether to run the inference. This part requires a GPU. AlphaFold 3 Input See the input documentation. AlphaFold 3 Output See the output documentation. Performance See the performance documentation. Known Issues Known issues are documented in the known issues documentation. Please create an issue if it is not already listed in Known Issues or in the issues tracker.
