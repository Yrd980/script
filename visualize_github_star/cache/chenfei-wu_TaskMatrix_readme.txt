TaskMatrix TaskMatrix connects ChatGPT and a series of Visual Foundation Models to enable sending and receiving images during chatting.

Thanks @jordddan for his efforts. For the image editing case, is first used to locate bounding boxes guided by given text, then is used to generate the related mask, and finally stable diffusion inpainting is used to edit image based on the mask. - Firstly, run - Then, say or . is an object. TaskMatrix will return the detection or segmentation result! - Now TaskMatrix can support Chinese! Thanks to @Wang-Xiaodong1899 for his efforts. - We propose the template idea in TaskMatrix! - A template is a pre-defined execution flow that assists ChatGPT in assembling complex tasks involving multiple foundation models. - A template contains the experiential solution to complex tasks as determined by humans. - A template can invoke multiple foundation models or even establish a new ChatGPT session - To define a template, simply adding a class with attributes - Thanks to @ShengmingYin and @thebestannie for providing a template example in class see the following gif - Firstly, run - Secondly, say to TaskMatrix! - By simply creating an template, TaskMatrix can seamlessly extend images to any size through collaboration with existing , , and foundation models, without the need for additional training. - TaskMatrix needs the effort of the community! We crave your contribution to add new and interesting features! <img src="./assets/demoinf.gif" width="750"> Insight & Goal: On the one hand, ChatGPT or LLMs serves as a general interface that provides a broad and diverse understanding of a wide range of topics. On the other hand, Foundation Models serve as domain experts by providing deep knowledge in specific domains. By leveraging both general and deep knowledge, we aim at building an AI that is capable of handling various tasks.
