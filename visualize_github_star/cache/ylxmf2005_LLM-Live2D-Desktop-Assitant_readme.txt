LLM-Live2D-Desktop-Assitant Notice ~~I’m currently working on the reconstruction co-work of the upstream repository Open-LLM-Vtuber. Once the foundational reconstruction is complete, this repository Electron version will be updated accordingly.~~ I may no longer update the repo because as I am transferring the Electron feature to the upstream repository. You can directly utilize the desktop mode in the upstream repository. 🤗Introduction Forked From Open-LLM-VTuber and made the following modifications / new features: - Integrate with Electron to be the desktop partner. The desktop-mode supports both Windows and MacOS. - Add screen sensing function and clipboard content retrieval. - Write an Elaina persona prompt. - Set the ElainaLSS as the default Live2D model and create some expressions and poses. - Use GPTSoVITS as the TTS model to clone Elaina's timbre. - Improve to concurrently TTS subsequent streaming sentences while the current sentence is being spoken. - Add a voice wake-up feature. Elaina enters a sleep mode after a certain period 10s of inactivity following each conversation chain. She can be reactivated using the wake word "Elaina". - Add singing functionality using Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion. - Add computer use function using Claude API. - Support packaging the frontend as an exe or dmg. 👀Demo The demo videos don't reflect the latest version. The leaked API keys in these videos also don't work. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/030bff1b-63a2-4b43-848b-a0c5b9db6f42 https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77157c00-5be8-4f99-b549-b13ad113be52 https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/491714cd-5d59-44f4-b100-b4a89ca1d9e2 https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58785339-34eb-4d5c-9413-f0e9f5810be0 https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/badca04a-5ece-478c-a175-5e4bc3f563df https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c6cfb7-63cc-4983-a541-6dcaace1ad3c ⚠️Statement To use this project, it is recommended to have at least basic Python programming skills. Please refer carefully to the original project's Wiki. For usage details and customization, you might need to consult the relevant project documentation if you require corresponding components and read or modify this project's code. Due to copyright issues, some models used in this project will not be public. 🛠️Usage Require python >= 3.11. GPTSoVITS if needed - Download the Elaina GPTSoVITS model. - Download GPT-SoVITS-v2-240821, and configure the according to the official document. - run . DeepLX if needed - Launch DeepLX server if you want Elaina to say Japanese Because the model's responses usually use the same language as the system prompt/user's input, you can run . Environment Configuration - - - Modify according to your needs. For more details, please read this Wiki. Wake-up if needed - Obtain your Picovoice access key. - Set the in to your own access key. Clipboard retrieval & Screen sensing if needed Better to use with a snipping tool like Snipaste. Read in for details. For screen sensing, please set your vllm in Computer-use if needed The feature is currently running on the backend computer and will be migrated to Electron in the future. Experimental, only for MacOS. Set your in . Will support Windows in the future. Desktop-mode Dev, recommended - - Desktop-mode Build, to get exe on Windows, dmg on macOS - - , the executable file frontend will be generated in . - If you are using Windows, make sure the terminal running has administrative privileges. - to start backend service Due to flexibility and environment management, packaging backend is not supported, but may be supported in the future - Open the executable file Tip: To deploy the frontend and backend in different device, you need to modify in to your server's address and port which can be set in . Web-mode - 📋To Do List - Sync with the upstream repository Continuous work. - Move computer functions to electron. - Add timbre recognition function. - Use smarter algorithms to detect if the user has stopped speaking. - Enhance the UI by adding input field, chat history. - Add more expressions and poses like random idle poses. - Allow the LLM to access the Internet. 👏Acknowledgement - Thank t41372 for the Open-LLM-VTuber. - Thank MNDIA for the Live2D model - Thank 灰发的伊蕾娜 for the GPTSoVITS model.
