Phosh A pure Wayland shell for mobile devices like smart phones or small tablets which use touch input are running battery powered most of the time have limited screen space have a limited number of buttons might be docked to a keyboard, screen and other input devices Typical devices are the Librem 5 and PinePhone or devices formerly running proprietary operating systems like the OnePlus 6/6T. The companion Wayland compositor is phoc. License phosh is licensed under the GPL-3.0-or-later licence. Getting the source The main branch has the current development version. Dependencies On a Debian based system run For an explicit list of dependencies check the entry in the debian/control file. Building We use the meson and thereby Ninja build system for phosh. The quickest way to get going is to do the following: Testing To run the tests run For details see the .gitlab-ci.yml file. Running Running from the source tree When running from the source tree start the compositor phoc. Then start phosh using: or if you built phoc from source in ../phoc in one command: This will make sure the needed gsettings schema is found. Note that there's no need to install any files outside the source tree. The result should look something like this: !phosh Running from the Debian packages If you're running a display manager like GDM or LightDM you can select the session from the display managers menu. For development purposes you can use the provided systemd unit: This runs phosh as the user with user id 1000 which needs to exist. If you don't have that user and don't want to create one you can make systemd run phosh as any user by using an override file: All of the above use the script to start compositor and shell under the hood so if you just want to start phosh from the system console once invoke that script directly.
