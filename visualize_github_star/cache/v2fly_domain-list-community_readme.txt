Domain list community This project manages a list of domains, to be used as geosites for routing purpose in Project V. Purpose of this project This project is not opinionated. In other words, it does NOT endorse, claim or imply that a domain should be blocked or proxied. It can be used to generate routing rules on demand.

Generate manually - Install and - Clone project code: - Navigate to project root directory: - Install project dependencies: - Generate without option means to use domain lists in directory of current working directory: - - Run for more usage information. Structure of data All data are under directory. Each file in the directory represents a sub-list of domains, named by the file name. File content is in the following format. Syntax: > The following types of rules are NOT fully compatible with the ones that defined by user in V2Ray config file. Do Not copy and paste directly. Comment begins with . It may begin anywhere in the file. The content in the line after is treated as comment and ignored in production. Inclusion begins with , followed by the file name of an existing file in the same directory. Subdomain begins with , followed by a valid domain name. The prefix may be omitted. Keyword begins with , followed by a string. Regular expression begins with , followed by a valid regular expression per Golang's standard. Full domain begins with , followed by a complete and valid domain name. Domains including , , and may have one or more attributes. Each attribute begins with and followed by the name of the attribute. > Note: Adding new and rules is discouraged because it is easy to use them incorrectly, and proxy software cannot efficiently match these types of rules. How it works The entire directory will be built into an external file for Project V. Each file in the directory represents a section in the generated file. To generate a section: 1. Remove all the comments in the file. 2. Replace lines with the actual content of the file. 3. Omit all empty lines. 4. Generate each line into a sub-domain routing rule. 5. Generate each line into a plain domain routing rule. 6. Generate each line into a regex domain routing rule. 7. Generate each line into a full domain routing rule. How to organize domains File name Theoretically any string can be used as the name, as long as it is a valid file name. In practice, we prefer names for determinic group of domains, such as the owner usually a company name of the domains, e.g., "google", "netflix". Names with unclear scope are generally unrecommended, such as "evil", or "local". Attributes Attribute is useful for sub-group of domains, especially for filtering purpose. For example, the list of domains may contains its main domains, as well as domains that serve ads. The ads domains may be marked by attribute , and can be used as in V2Ray routing.
