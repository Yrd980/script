Initially launched in 2016 as a tool for assisting developers in migrating their projects to newer versions of Visual Studio, vcpkg has evolved into a cross-platform tool used by developers on Windows, macOS, and Linux. vcpkg has a large collection of open-source libraries and enterprise-ready features designed to facilitate your development process with support for any build and project systems. vcpkg is a C++ tool at heart and is written in C++ with scripts in CMake. It is designed from the ground up to address the unique pain points C/C++ developers experience. This tool and ecosystem are constantly evolving, and we always appreciate contributions! Learn how to start contributing with our packaging tutorial and maintainer guide. Get started First, follow one of our quick start guides. Whether you're using CMake, MSBuild, or any other build system, vcpkg has you covered: vcpkg with CMake vcpkg with MSBuild vcpkg with other build systems You can also use any editor: vcpkg with Visual Studio vcpkg with Visual Studio Code vcpkg with CLion vcpkg with Qt Creator If a library you need is not present in the vcpkg registry, open an issue on the GitHub repositorycontributing:submit-issue or contribute the package yourself. After you've gotten vcpkg installed and working, you may wish to add tab completion to your terminal. Use vcpkg Create a manifest for your project's dependencies: Or install packages through the command line: Then use one of our available integrations for CMake, MSBuild or other build systems. For a short description of all available commands, run . Run for details on a specific topic. Key features vcpkg offers powerful features for your package management needs: easily integrate with your build system control the versions of your dependencies package and publish your own packages reuse your binary artifacts enable offline scenarios with asset caching Contribute vcpkg is an open source project, and is thus built with your contributions.

For use behind a firewall, the specific access needed will depend on which ports are being installed. If you must install it in an "air gapped" environment, consider instaling once in a non-"air gapped" environment, populating an asset cache shared with the otherwise "air gapped" environment.
