<div align="center"> <h1>macchina</h1> Fast, minimal and customizable system information frontend. Linux • macOS • Windows • NetBSD • FreeBSD • OpenWrt • Android <img src="assets/preview.png" alt="Preview" /> </div> About macchina lets you view system information, like your kernel version, uptime, memory usage, processor load and much more. macchina is basic by default and customizable by design. If you're interested in the library macchina uses to fetch system information, have a look at libmacchinalibmacchina; fetching-related issues should be filed on that repository. Status macchina is now in maintenance mode, the only form of contribution we will accept moving forward is bug fixes and documentation improvements. macchina is a perfectly good fetcher, it has achieved its intended purpose for me as well as others. Benchmarks Check out the benchmarks wiki page. Features Themes macchina has a theming system which you can use to customize pretty much any visual aspect of the program. Themes live outside the configuration file, so you can create a bunch of them and switch between them at any time. Why are they separate? - Modularity — themes are an engine of their own, and their sole purpose is to provide an interface that allows for the modification of macchina's visual components. It makes sense to separate them from the main configuration file. - Portability — sure, the configuration file is shareable, but what if you wanted to share the look of your macchina and not its behavior? What if you wanted to switch between dozens of themes that you very carefully designed? The way we handle customization answers this need. Learn how to make your own. Doctor In the event of fetching failures, which can occur for various reasons, the flag can tell you why that might be happening. Configuration See the configuration wiki pageconfiguration. Customization Have a look at the customization wiki pagecustomization. Installation Check out the installation wiki pageinstallation. We also provide prebuilt binariesreleases with every release. Contributors macchina like many other open source projects, would not be where it is right now without the help of its contributors. Whether you've helped drive it forward by contributing to the codebase, packaged it so we didn't have to, or recommended it to someone you know — we truly appreciate your support! The following is a list of awesome people that have truly shaped macchina: - pin: Provided massive amounts of help, feedback and testing, and is currently packaging macchina on NetBSD. - 123marvin123: Co-author of libmacchina and author of countless high-quality contributions and primarily, support for macOS and Windows. - uttarayan21: Co-author of libmacchina and author of numerous shipshape contributions and primarily, support for Android and OpenWrt.
