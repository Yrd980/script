Your prompts remain under your control, always accessible. - 🔍 Evaluate: Automatically run evals on traces or sessions using the latest platforms: LastMile or Ragas more coming soon - 🎛️ Fine-tune: Fine-tune with one of our fine-tuning partners: OpenPipe or Autonomi more coming soon - 🛜 Gateway: Caching, custom rate limits, LLM security, and more with our gateway - 🛡️ Enterprise Ready: SOC 2 and GDPR compliant > 🎁 Generous monthly free tier 10k requests/month - No credit card required! Quick Start ⚡️ One line of code 1. Get your API key by signing up here. 2. Update only the in your code: or - use headers for more secure environments 3. 🎉 You're all set! View your logs at Helicone. > This quick start uses Helicone Cloud with OpenAI. For other providers or self-hosted options, see below. Get Started For Free Helicone Cloud Recommended The fastest and most reliable way to get started with Helicone. Get started for free at Helicone US or Helicone EU. Your first 100k requests are free every month, after which you'll pay based on usage. Try our demo to see Helicone in action! Integrations: View our supported integrations. Latency Concerns: Helicone's Cloud offering is deployed on Cloudflare workers and ensures the lowest latency ~10ms add-on to your API requests. View our latency benchmarks. Self-Hosting Open Source LLM Observability with Helicone Docker Helicone is simple to self-host and update. To get started locally, just use our docker-compose file. Pre-Request: - Copy the shared directory to the valhalla directory - Create a valhalla folder in the valhalla directory and put /valhalla/jawn in it Helm For Enterprise workloads, we also have a production-ready Helm chart available. To access, contact us at enterprise@helicone.ai. Manual Not Recommended Manual deployment is not recommended. Please use Docker or Helm. If you must, follow the instructions here. Architecture Helicone is comprised of five services: - Web: Frontend Platform NextJS - Worker: Proxy Logging Cloudflare Workers - Jawn: Dedicated Server for serving collecting logs Express + Tsoa - Supabase: Application Database and Auth - ClickHouse: Analytics Database - Minio: Object Storage for logs.
