Hovering over it will show additional stats like response time and status code. Status indicators can be globally enabled by setting or enabled/ disabled on a per-item basis. Status is checked on page load, but you can allow continuous polling by specifying a time interval between checks, in seconds under . You can also use a different endpoint for status checking, with , and if needed, pass in custom headers under . <p align="center"> <img alt="Status Checks demo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/status-check-demo.gif" width="600" /> </p> ⬆️ Back to Top --- Widgets 📊 > For full widget documentation, see: Widgets You can display dynamic content from services in the form of widgets.

To that end, instant search and customizable keyboard shortcuts are built-in. To start filtering, start typing—no need to select the search bar or use any special key. Then use either the tab key or arrow keys to select and move between results, and hit enter to launch the currently selected application. For apps that you use regularly, you can set a custom keybinding. Use the parameter on a certain item to specify a numeric key between . You can then launch that app by just pressing that key.

Changes will be visible immediately but will not be saved until clicking "Save to Disk" or "Save Locally". Under the config menu, you can export, view, backup, or reset app config and edit the raw config file in a text editor with built-in schema validation. It's recommended to keep a backup of your config. <p align="center"> <img alt="Interactive Editor demo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1862727/139543020-b0576d28-0830-476f-afc8-a815d4de6def.gif" width="600" /> </p> <p align="center"> <img alt="Config Editor demo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/config-editor-demo.gif" width="600" /> </p> ⬆️ Back to Top --- Cloud Backup & Sync ☁ > For full backup documentation, see: Cloud Backup & Sync Dashy has an optional built-in feature for securely backing up your config to a hosted cloud service and then restoring it on another instance. This is useful not only for backing up your configuration off-site but also enables Dashy to be used without having to write a YAML config file. All data is fully E2E encrypted before being sent to the backend done in https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/CloudBackup.js using crypto.js 's AES method. The data is then sent to a Cloudflare worker and stored in a KV data store. ⬆️ Back to Top --- Language Switching 🌎 > For full internationalization documentation, see: Multi-Language Support Dashy supports multiple languages and locales. When available, your language should be automatically detected and applied on load. But you can also select a language through the UI under config --> Switch Language or set to your language specified as a 2-digit ISO 639-1 code, as seen below, e.g. .

If you've got a few minutes to spare, consider adding translations for your language. It's a quick task, and all text is in a single JSON file. Since any missing text will fall back to English, you don't need to translate it all. ⬆️ Back to Top --- Multi-Page Support 📃 > For full multi-page documentation, see: Pages & Sections Within your dashboard, you can have as many sub-pages as you require. To load additional pages, specify a name, and path to a config file under . The config file can be either local stored in , or remote located anywhere accessible. Or --- System Requirements 📊 If running on bare metal, Dashy requires Node V 16.0.0 or later, LTS 16.13.2 is recommended. If running in Docker container, the recommended base image is Alpine 3.15 The hardware requirements vary depending on where and how you are running Dashy. Generally speaking, on a bare-metal system or Docker container, 1GB of memory should be more than enough, and depending on whether you are using your own assets, then 1GB of disk space should be sufficient. If you are using one of the 1-click cloud deployment methods, serving the app through a CDN or using a static hosting provider, then there are no specific requirements, as the built app is just a series of static JS files, and so is very light-weight. Dashy also wells run on low-powered ARM-based single board computers, such as a Raspberry Pi tested on Pi 3 Browser Support !Chrome | !Firefox | !IE | !Opera | !Safari --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | Latest ✔ | Latest ✔ | 10+ ✔ | Latest ✔ | 6.1+ ❌ | ⬆️ Back to Top --- Support 🙋‍♀️ If you're having trouble getting Dashy up and running, or have a question about usage or configuration, feel free to ask. The best place to do this is via the Discussions. If you've found something which isn't working as it should, please raise a bug by opening a ticket. It's best to check the docs, previous issues and troubleshooting guide first. ⬆️ Back to Top --- Supporting Dashy 💖 > For full details and other ways you can help out, see: Contributing If you're using Dashy and would like to help support its development, then that would be awesome!
