Adding / removing abbreviations or aliases The plugin automatically track changes when adding/removing abbreviations or aliases using or commands see behind the scenes, so you won't see tips anymore for an abbreviation/alias that has been erased, and you will get new ones for newly added abbreviations/aliases üõ† Configuration Configuration is done through environment variables. To avoid spamming your , you can set environment variables using once to make them persistent across restarts and share them across fish's instances. Default configuration Tips prompt By default, tips will show up like this : But you can customize it using the prompt environment variable. The plugin will replace with the abbreviation/alias and with the corresponding command. ‚ö†Ô∏è tips are displayed using interpretation of backslash escapes Alias whitelist By default, if the command is a user-defined function alias, the plugin won't search for a matching abbreviation because your aliases names are likely to be uniques, so there wouldn't be abbreviations with the same names. But, in some cases, you may write aliases that wrap existing commands without altering their actual execution e.g., add some hooks before/after the command execution. In this special case, you may also have abbreviations using these aliases, so you don't want to ignore them. To do that, add these aliases to the environment variable. Regexes If the command doesn't match an abbreviation/alias exactly, it is tested against some regexes to extract a possible abbreviation/alias. For example, you could have an abbreviation/alias like this : So you want a tip when typing , but the command doesn't match exactly . To tackle this, we have a default regex that will match commands with arguments removed, so your will be tested as . You can add such regexes to the list, and they will be tested in the order in which they have been added see default configuration. Matching is lazy, so if the string extracted with the first regex matches an abbreviation/alias, it won't go further. Remember that only the first matching group will be tested. so you must have at least one per regex üé• Behind the scenes In order to not slow down your prompt, the plugin store abbreviations/aliases and their corresponding commands in lists actually simulating a dictionary, as fish doesn't support dict yet to avoid iterating over all abbreviations/aliases each time you type a command. So retrieving an abbreviation or an alias from a command is fast as it doesn't involve any loop. The plugin will create lists once during installation by calling in the background more precisely in spawned shell, because fish doesn't put functions in background. Then, lists will get updated when you add or remove abbreviation/alias using or builtin. üí≠ Inspiration Inspired by zsh-fast-alias-tips and alias-tips zsh plugins üìù License MIT
