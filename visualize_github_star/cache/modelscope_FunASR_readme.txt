By supporting the training & finetuning of the industrial-grade speech recognition model, researchers and developers can conduct research and production of speech recognition models more conveniently, and promote the development of speech recognition ecology. ASR for FunÔºÅ Highlights | News | Installation | Quick Start | Tutorial | Runtime | Model Zoo | Contact <a name="highlights"></a> Highlights - FunASR is a fundamental speech recognition toolkit that offers a variety of features, including speech recognition ASR, Voice Activity Detection VAD, Punctuation Restoration, Language Models, Speaker Verification, Speaker Diarization and multi-talker ASR. FunASR provides convenient scripts and tutorials, supporting inference and fine-tuning of pre-trained models. - We have released a vast collection of academic and industrial pretrained models on the ModelScope and huggingface, which can be accessed through our Model Zoo. The representative Paraformer-large, a non-autoregressive end-to-end speech recognition model, has the advantages of high accuracy, high efficiency, and convenient deployment, supporting the rapid construction of speech recognition services.

More detailed information about service deployment can be found in the deployment roadmap&40;funasr/runtime/readmecn.md&41;. <a name="quick-start"></a> Quick Start Below is a quick start tutorial. Test audio files Mandarin, English. Command-line usage Notes: Support recognition of single audio file, as well as file list in Kaldi-style wav.scp format: Speech Recognition Non-streaming SenseVoice Parameter Description: - : The name of the model, or the path to the model on the local disk. - : This indicates the activation of VAD Voice Activity Detection. The purpose of VAD is to split long audio into shorter clips. In this case, the inference time includes both VAD and SenseVoice total consumption, and represents the end-to-end latency. If you wish to test the SenseVoice model's inference time separately, the VAD model can be disabled. - : Specifies the configurations for the VAD model. : denotes the maximum duration for audio segmentation by the , with the unit being milliseconds ms. - : Whether the output result includes punctuation and inverse text normalization. - : Indicates the use of dynamic batching, where the total duration of audio in the batch is measured in seconds s. - : Whether to merge short audio fragments segmented by the VAD model, with the merged length being , in seconds s. - : Whether to ban the output of the token. Paraformer Note: : represents the model repository, stands for selecting ModelScope download, stands for selecting Huggingface download. Speech Recognition Streaming Note: is the configuration for streaming latency. indicates that the real-time display granularity is , and the lookahead information is . Each inference input is sample points are , and the output is the corresponding text. For the last speech segment input, needs to be set to force the output of the last word. <details><summary>More Examples</summary> Voice Activity Detection Non-Streaming Note: The output format of the VAD model is: , where indicates the starting/ending point of the valid audio segment, measured in milliseconds. Voice Activity Detection Streaming Note: The output format for the streaming VAD model can be one of four scenarios: - ÔºöThe same as the offline VAD output result mentioned above. - ÔºöIndicates that only a starting point has been detected. - ÔºöIndicates that only an ending point has been detected. - ÔºöIndicates that neither a starting point nor an ending point has been detected. The output is measured in milliseconds and represents the absolute time from the starting point.
