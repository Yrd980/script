SwayOSD A OSD window for common actions like volume and capslock. This is my first time coding in Rust so fixes and improvements are appreciated : Features: - LibInput listener Backend for these keys: - Caps Lock - Num Lock - Scroll Lock - Input and output volume change indicator - Input and output mute change indicator - Customizable maximum Volume - Capslock change Note: doesn't change the caps lock state - Brightness change indicator Images !image !image Install: There's a new LibInput watcher binary shipped with SwayOSD which can automatically detect key presses, so no need for binding key combos. The supported keys are listed above in Features Through Meson AUR Available on the AUR thanks to @jgmdev! Don't open a issue here about AUR package - swayosd-git Debian / Ubuntu Starting with Debian trixie and Ubuntu Plucky swayosd is available via apt. - swayosd Usage: SwayOSD LibInput Backend Using Systemd: Other users can run: SwayOSD Frontend Sway examples Start Server Add Client bindings Notes on using : - It is for audio devices only. - If it is omitted the default audio device is used. - It only changes the target device for the current action that changes the volume. - You can list your input audio devices using , for outputs replace with . Notes on using : - By default, without using --monitor the osd will be shown on all monitors - On setups with multiple monitors, if you only want to show the osd on the focused monitor, you can do so with the help of window manager specific commands: Theming Since SwayOSD uses GTK, its appearance can be changed. Initially scss is used, which GTK does not support, so we need to use plain css. The style conifg file is in it is not automatically generated. For reference you can check this and this. Brightness Control Some devices may not have permission to write . So using the provided packaged rules + adding the user to group by running , everything should work as expected.
