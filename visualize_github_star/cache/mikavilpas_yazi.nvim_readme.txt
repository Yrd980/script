üé≤ A Neovim Plugin for yazi <a href="https://dotfyle.com/plugins/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim"> <img src="https://dotfyle.com/plugins/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim/shield?style=flat-square" alt="shield image for plugin usage" /> </a> !LuaRockshttps://luarocks.org/modules/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim !Type checked codebasehttps://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim/actions/workflows/typecheck.yml Yazi is a blazing fast file manager for the terminal. This plugin allows you to open yazi in a floating window in Neovim. <https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim/assets/300791/c7ff98ee-54d6-4ad0-9318-903e4b674f84> ‚ú® Features - Press to display all keymaps! - Open yazi in a floating window. All visible splits are opened as yazi tabs for easy and fast navigation. - Files that are hovered in yazi are highlighted in Neovim to intuitively show where you are in relation to your Neovim session. Currently this works for splits that you have open. - Files selected in yazi can be opened in various ways: as the current buffer, a vertical split, a horizontal split, a new tab, as quickfix items... - if you have selected a file path in visual mode, yazi will open that file instead of current file - Integrations to other plugins and tools, if they are installed: - For telescope.nvim, fzf-lua.nvim and snacks.picker: you can grep/search in the directory yazi is in. Select some files to limit the search to those files only. - Using a bundled version of snacks.bufdelete to have yazi close buffers and preserve the window layout. This happens when files that are open are deleted in yazi. - For grug-far.nvim: you can search and replace in the directory yazi is in - Copy the relative path from the start file to the currently hovered file. Requires realpath 1 on linux and windows, or grealpath on osx - If multiple files are selected, they can be sent to the quickfix list - optionally open yazi instead of netrw for directories - Files that are renamed, moved, or deleted in yazi are kept in sync with open buffers in Neovim - The files are also kept in sync with currently running LSP servers. A technical explanation is available here. - Customizable keybindings - Plugin management for Yazi plugins and flavors documentation - üÜï Send custom commands to yazi documentation For previewing images with yazi, see Yazi's documentation related to Neovim here. üì¶ Installation First, make sure you have the requirements: - Neovim 0.11.0 or later nightly - yazi 0.4.0 or later - New features might require a recent version of yazi see installing-yazi-from-source.md > !TIP > > You can run to see if compatible versions are installed > and working. ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Using lazy.nvim This is the preferred installation method. Notice that yazi.nvim adds and lazy loads some minimal dependencies for you automatically when using a plugin manager like lazy.nvim. To see which dependencies are installed, see lazy.lua. If you are not using lazy.nvim or rocks.nvim, you need to install the dependencies yourself. Also see the discussion in issue 306 and examples of other Neovim plugins using this feature. Without a package manager <details> <summary>Instructions</summary> If you are not using lazy.nvim, see lazy.lua for what dependencies are required. </details> ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings These are the default keybindings that are available when yazi is open: - : show the help menu - : open the selected files in vertical splits - : open the selected files in horizontal splits - : open the selected files in new tabs - : send the selected files to the quickfix list - There are also integrations to other plugins, which you need to install separately: - : search in the current yazi directory using telescope's , if available. Optionally you can use fzf-lua.nvim, snacks.picker or provide your own implementation - see the instructions in the configuration section for more info. - if multiple files/directories are selected in yazi, the search and replace will only be done in the selected files/directories - : search and replace in the current yazi directory using grug-far, if available - if multiple files/directories are selected in yazi, the operation is limited to those only - : copy the relative path of the selected files to the clipboard. Requires GNU or on OSX - also available for the snacks.nvim picker, see documentation/copy-relative-path-to-files.md for more information - : make yazi jump to the open buffers in Neovim.

You can optionally configure yazi.nvim by setting any of the options below. > !TIP > > If you are adding custom bindings for special use cases, you can use the lua > api. It allows customizing the configuration on a per call basis. For example, > you can open yazi with a different configuration by calling > to override some of your > default settings for this specific call. ü™õ Customizing yazi Yazi is highly customizable. It features its own plugin and event system, themes, and keybindings. This section lists some of the plugins and themes that I like. - <https://github.com/DreamMaoMao/easyjump.yazi> allows jumping to a line by typing a hint character, much like hop.nvim. - <https://github.com/Rolv-Apneseth/starship.yazi> is a port of the starship prompt to yazi. It allows reusing the starship prompt you are using in your shell in yazi. - <https://github.com/yazi-rs/flavors> houses many of the most popular themes as yazi flavors, check it out! They typically also include matching code highlighting. Contributing Please see COMMUNITY.md for more information on the project! In case there are issues See reproducing-issues.md.
