Note: you can configure every shortcut by going to Settings > Controls User interface The idea is to have a uncluttered, simple and easy to use UI. You can see UI elements only when you need them. There is a pull-down panel with thumbnails, as well as folder view. You can also bring up a context menu via right click. Using quick copy / quick move panels Bring up the panel with C or M shortcut. You will see 9 destination directories, click on the folder icon to change them. With panel visible, use 1 - 9 keys to copy/move current image to corresponding directory. When you are done press C or M again to hide the panel. Running scripts You can run custom scripts on a current image. Open Settings > Scripts. Press Add. Here you can choose between a shell command and a shell script. Example of a command: Example of a shell script file will be image path: Note: The script file must be an executable. Also, "shebang" needs to be present. When you've created your script go to Settings > Controls > Add, then select it and assign a shortcut like for any regular action. HiDPI Linux / MacOS only If qimgv appears too small / too big on your display, you can override the scale factor. Example: You can put it in file to make it permanent. Using values less than is not supported. qimgv should also obey the global scale factor set in KDE's systemsettings. High quality scaling qimgv supports nicer scaling filters when compiled with support ON by default, but might vary depending on your linux distribution.
