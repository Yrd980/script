First, please read our Contribution Guide and Code of Conduct. We explicitly welcome contributions from people who have never contributed to open-source before: we were all beginners once! We can help build on a partially working pull request with the aim of getting it merged. We are also actively seeking to diversify our contributors and especially welcome contributions from women from all backgrounds and people of colour. A good starting point for contributing is to first tap , then run with some of the packages you use e.g. if you use and read through the warnings. Try to fix them until shows no results and submit a pull request. If no formulae you use have warnings you can run without arguments to have it run on all packages and pick one. Alternatively, for something more substantial, check out one of the issues labelled in Homebrew/brew or Homebrew/homebrew-core. Good luck!
