Kinto.sh !kinto-color-132 !GitHub releasehttps://github.com/rbreaves/kinto/releases/latest \- Mac-style shortcut keys for Linux & Windows. \- Seamless copy and paste with all apps and terminals. The zero effort solution. v1.2 Release - Kinto now includes a system tray and simple wizard to setup the install with minimal effort. Kinto is powered by xkeysnail for Linux & by Autohotkey for Windows 10 & 11. Note: VNC is now experimentally supported on Linux w/ the latest releases, but you must compile & install x11vnc. More info can be found here. ~~Note: If you plan to remote into Linux via VNC, xRDP, Synergy or other remote desktop solutions then remove the current release & try an earlier v1.0.7-3 release. It uses xkb so it'll work with virtual xinput devices. Some v1.1-x releases may offer both, but all v1.2.x releases ended support for xkb. I do plan to bring offical support back for virtual input devices.~~ Table of Contents Donations If you like or appreciate this project then please consider donating. |Wishlists|Amazon|Adafruit|eBay| |---|---|---|---| I have received some really great letters with donations & email.

What's different from other remappers? What does Kinto require? Shortcut Creation How to Upgrade/Control Kinto Troubleshooting Language Support Related or Useful Resources Contributing More information about Kinto License Credits and Contributions What does this do exactly? Kinto works for standard Windows, Apple and Chromebook keyboards. The following however describes the dynamic rebinding based on a standard Windows/Mac keyboard. - Cursor/word-wise shortcut keys have been added to align with macOS keyboard shortcuts. GUI |Physical| Ctrl | Win/Alt | Alt/Cmd | Spacebar| |---|---|---|---|---| |Virtual| Win/Super | Alt | RCtrl |Spacebar| Win/Super will properly remap to LCtrl when needed to fully support expected keymaps. Terminal |Physical| Ctrl | Win/Alt | Alt/Cmd | Spacebar| |---|---|---|---|---| |Virtual| LCtrl | Alt | RCtrl |Spacebar| Note: RCtrl for terminals is also adding in Shift most of the time, however it depends on the specific terminal in use and will change itself to the expected keymaps of that terminal application. What's different? Compared to most other remappers this is a complete system-wide remap of your base level modifier keys, this saves time. You're not going to die a death of a thousand papercuts from trying to support every shortcut key under the sun. It also retains some of the most commonly used system level shortcut keys, such as Cmd-C/V, Cmd-Tab, and Ctrl-Tab among others. You will keep seamless copy & paste between all apps, ability to switch Windows while still using the physical Cmd/Alt key position; switch tabs in your favorite terminals, code editors, or web browsers. Depending on your OS and/or Desktop Environment you may also be able to switch Virtual Desktop environments the same way as well and other basic system level shortcuts. If your OS and macOS have similar functionality on the system level, but only differ by a slight difference of a shortcut command then Kinto likely supports it already. If Kinto doesn't have what you need then you can open up a support ticket and it will be added. You can also fork the project to add the fix and I will merge it via a PR you make. Additionally, if you are using a cross-platform app and if it happens to have a few shortcut keys that differ then that can very easily be added to either the kinto.py or kinto.ahk configuration files which on Windows is located here and on Linux it can be found here . More info can be found here Shortcut Creation What does Kinto require? - Python - systemd or sysvinit - x11 - xkeysnail Kinto for Windows 10 Requirements - Git for Windows - Powershell - run as Administrator - Python3 Other programs that will be installed when you run ./setup.py - Chocolatey - Autohotkey - Strawberry Perl Note: Sublime Text users should disable screen rotation hotkeys as they will interfere with multi-cursor and possibly other combos. See https://windowsloop.com/disable-screen-rotation-keyboard-shortcut/ for details. You may also want to disable the Xbox Game Bar so that Win+G or other shortcuts will not interfere with any of your remaps. Start menu -> Game bar shortcuts -> toggle Off. Shortcut Creation Linux Shortcut Creation Xkeysnail Windows Shortcut Creation Autohotkey Linux Xkeysnail GUI Keys | Value| Description|Mac/Kinto Equivalent| | ----- |:--------:|:--------:| |C,Ctrl|Control|Cmd| |M,Alt| Alt/Option|Alt/Option| |Super | Win/Super|Ctrl| Terminal Keys | Value| Description|Mac/Kinto Equivalent| | ----- |:--------:|:--------:| |RC,RCtrl|Right Control → Left & Right Alt/Cmd key|Cmd| |M,Alt|Alt/Option|Alt/Option| |LC,LCtrl |Left Control|Ctrl| You can define new keymaps for your specific app via this method. You also do not have to cancel out the original keybinding if you do not need or want to, but you can do so with "passthroughkey". Defining Keymaps Per App In the above example I am also showing that you can define a single shortcut to enact multiple shortcut keys if needed by defining an array of shortcuts to trigger. To make changes you can edit ~/.config/kinto/kinto.py under linux & restart the xkeysnail service via the system tray, app or CLI. systemd sysvinit More information can be seen on the readme page of xkeysnail. Windows Autohotkey This applies to the Windows version of Kinto and how to add additional support for Applications. The configuration file location is and after updating it you will want to right click on the tray icon and click on setting your keyboard type again and it will re-apply the latest changes. Windows 10 has a couple of ways that you need to be aware of when trying to add a specific application, the typical method of how to add any exe program, but then there is also the newer UWP app format that some applications use which will require a similar but different method, both will be discussed. Defining Keymaps Per App by EXE Name You can use the following legend but realize that these remaps reference the Virtual keys in the diagrams mentioned near the beginning of this document, so do not confuse it with the physical key unless they happen to be the same key. |Autohotkey Symbol|Virtual key|Description| |---|---|---| |^,Ctrl|Control|Primary modifier, 1st rock from the spacebar| |!,Alt|Alt|Secondary modifier, 2nd rock from the spacebar| |,Win|Win/Super|Tertiary modifier, 3rd rock from the spacebar| With this being Autohotkey you can easily pull knowledge from the Autohotkey forums for just about any issue you may have as well. Defining Keymaps Per UWP App I don't have too many examples on this one, most developers seem to be shying away from UWP. Kinto currently supports "Fluent Terminal" which is a UWP app, but it is also being grouped with other Terminal apps for hotkey remapping. You may take a look at that, but you may also want to try creating a new Autohotkey file and use the Window Spy feature built into Autohotkey to help you discover the full name and class names of any application. Shortcut Creation XKB The older xkb shortcut method info can be read about in ticket 125. How to Upgrade Kinto Simply bring down the latest then you can re-run the setup.py installer, it will stop the service and re-install Kinto. Note: If you have made any custom changes to ~/.config/kinto then you will need to backup or rename those directories before running an update. How to Control Kinto This info is now superceded by the fact that linux has a full fledge GUI and system tray app that is very easy to use, but I will keep the command line options for those that want to know what they are. Status systemd sysvinit Stop your keymap will return to normal systemd sysvinit Start systemd sysvinit Restart systemd sysvinit Troubleshooting Installed successfully, but modifier keys are not properly remapped? Are you using a VM on macOS? If so you may need to disable automatic remapping of the Cmd key when using Vmware Fusion of Parallels. Disable Parallels Re-mapping: 1 Open Parallels and go to Preferences. 2 Click Keyboard and disable the Virtual machine shortcuts. 3 Close Preferences. To disable keyboard mapping: 1 From Fusion's menu bar, click VMware Fusion > Preferences... 2 Click Keyboard & Mouse. 3 Click the Key Mappings tab. 4 Deselect Enable Key Mapping. Does not start when you log in or after you reboot? You may need to manually set your DISPLAY in the systemd service file. Normally it pulls in the proper DISPLAY value but if it doesn't you can try this. Another possibility is the SELinux could be enabled and needs to be set to permissive. aka /etc/selinux/config To reset the display variable You can use the Kinto.sh app or system tray to edit your service file. kinto.sh gui 1. Edit -> Edit Service kinto tray 1. Customize -> Edit Service or you can use your terminal. sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/xkeysnail.service If you continue to have issues then open a ticket and send me the info. Language Support I'd appreciate any help from people with non-US based keyboards, to help ensure that these keymaps and keyswap methods work in all or most languages.

I will list these things off in chronological order mostly. First off I'd like to thank the Stackoverflow and Stackexchange community. I have probably rubbed some mods the wrong way over there, but the people from the community in general are extremely helpful and gracious and without their contributions would have made this much more difficult. The person I'd like to thank most though from over there is Glen Whitney. Without his detailed explaining of how to rebind keys in xkb this would not have come together at all, as every other remapping solution were non-starters as complexity increases. Kinto today no longer uses xkb, but Glen Whitney did provide the basis of a workable method that helped me pursue this method and think it was a worthwhile project to pursue, so for that I thank him. Secondarily I'd like to thank Christian Eriksson, as he provided information that kept me up at night.. literally. Even after I implemented a similar bash script to one he had suggested I knew that fully implementing a c/c++ solution was where Kinto needed to head to and his explanation was better than I remember it being now that I have gone back to read it again. He also never provided a full implementation of a c/c++ solution - he did hit on the pain points pretty well of what one would need to do and watch out for. I am not sure where I got the first example code of implementing a c based solution, but he definitely went over it well. Kui and his gist file was really the c based solution that I found had the fewest issues to resolve to making it a reliable solution. It didn't account for all failures very well, aka BadWindow issues, but it made for a great foundation on which Kintox11 is built. I cannot thank him enough for putting it out there for others to work with. Lastly these four people were also very helpful to me as well. @probonopd for being one of the first people to install and use Kinto and gave me the initial feedback to include wordwise support! He also has really great articles posted on HackerNews & Medium about UI/UX design. Another person I'd like to thank is @owzim, his feedback allowed me to rapidly iterate and fix several bugs to support additional platforms better. The last two are members of the ubuntu channel in IRC on freenode, tarzeau @alexmyczko and sarnold. Alex contributing a proper Makefile, so the project can be packaged properly, and sarnold help me find that IBus could resolve an issue I was having with needing to detect the caret status. Updated 6/13/2020 I would also like to thank Jonathan Chun for his patience in helping me work through a very difficult problem related to Alt-Tab switching, which led to the current xkeysnail iteration of Kinto for Linux that far exceeds the original xkb implementation. There are also several others that have created issue tickets that have contributed greatly. If I left anyone out then I apologize, that was not intentional. I am happy to say that this project is at a state of completion. Bug fixes will primarily be the only activity happening going forward and possibly a rewrite for Wayland at some point. Contributions as mentioned above are welcomed, and will be merged into master if they help with the goal of making typing on linux more like a mac. https://askubuntu.com/questions/1010276/can-i-act-on-the-event-that-a-window-opens-without-polling https://gist.github.com/kui/2622504 https://medium.com/@probonopd/make-it-simple-linux-desktop-usability-part-1-5fa0fb369b42
