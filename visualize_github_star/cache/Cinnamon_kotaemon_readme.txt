For developers - Framework for RAG Pipelines: Tools to build your own RAG-based document QA pipeline. - Customizable UI: See your RAG pipeline in action with the provided UI, built with <a href='https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio'>Gradio <img src='https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gradio-app/gradio'></a>. - Gradio Theme: If you use Gradio for development, check out our theme here: kotaemon-gradio-theme. Key Features - Host your own document QA RAG web-UI: Support multi-user login, organize your files in private/public collections, collaborate and share your favorite chat with others. - Organize your LLM & Embedding models: Support both local LLMs & popular API providers OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, Groq. - Hybrid RAG pipeline: Sane default RAG pipeline with hybrid full-text & vector retriever and re-ranking to ensure best retrieval quality. - Multi-modal QA support: Perform Question Answering on multiple documents with figures and tables support. Support multi-modal document parsing selectable options on UI. - Advanced citations with document preview: By default the system will provide detailed citations to ensure the correctness of LLM answers. View your citations incl. relevant score directly in the in-browser PDF viewer with highlights. Warning when retrieval pipeline return low relevant articles. - Support complex reasoning methods: Use question decomposition to answer your complex/multi-hop question. Support agent-based reasoning with , and other agents. - Configurable settings UI: You can adjust most important aspects of retrieval & generation process on the UI incl. prompts. - Extensible: Being built on Gradio, you are free to customize or add any UI elements as you like. Also, we aim to support multiple strategies for document indexing & retrieval. indexing pipeline is provided as an example. !Preview Installation > If you are not a developer and just want to use the app, please check out our easy-to-follow User Guide. Download the file from the latest release to get all the newest features and bug fixes. System requirements 1. Python >= 3.10 2. Docker: optional, if you install with Docker 3. Unstructured if you want to process files other than , , , and documents. Installation steps differ depending on your operating system. Please visit the link and follow the specific instructions provided there. With Docker recommended 1. We support both & version of Docker images. With version, the extra packages of will be installed, which can support additional file types , , ... but the cost is larger docker image size. For most users, the image should work well in most cases. - To use the version. - To use the version with bundled Ollama for local / private RAG. - To use the version. 2. We currently support and test two platforms: and for newer Mac. You can specify the platform by passing in the command. For example: 3. Once everything is set up correctly, you can go to to access the WebUI. 4. We use GHCR to store docker images, all images can be found here. Without Docker 1. Clone and install required packages on a fresh python environment. 2. Create a file in the root of this project. Use as a template The file is there to serve use cases where users want to pre-config the models before starting up the app e.g. deploy the app on HF hub. The file will only be used to populate the db once upon the first run, it will no longer be used in consequent runs. 3. Optional To enable in-browser viewer, download PDFJSDIST then extract it to <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/main/docs/images/pdf-viewer-setup.png" alt="pdf-setup" width="300"> 4. Start the web server: - The app will be automatically launched in your browser. - Default username and password are both . You can set up additional users directly through the UI. !Chat tab 5. Check the tab and and ensure that your value is set correctly from your file. If it is not set, you can set it there. Setup GraphRAG > !NOTE > Official MS GraphRAG indexing only works with OpenAI or Ollama API. > We recommend most users to use NanoGraphRAG implementation for straightforward integration with Kotaemon. <details> <summary>Setup Nano GRAPHRAG</summary> - Install nano-GraphRAG: - install might introduce version conflicts, see this issue - To quickly fix: - Launch Kotaemon with environment variable. - Set your default LLM & Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from NanoGraphRAG. </details> <details> <summary>Setup LIGHTRAG</summary> - Install LightRAG: - install might introduce version conflicts, see this issue - To quickly fix: - Launch Kotaemon with environment variable. - Set your default LLM & Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from LightRAG. </details> <details> <summary>Setup MS GRAPHRAG</summary> - Non-Docker Installation: If you are not using Docker, install GraphRAG with the following command: - Setting Up API KEY: To use the GraphRAG retriever feature, ensure you set the environment variable. You can do this directly in your environment or by adding it to a file. - Using Local Models and Custom Settings: If you want to use GraphRAG with local models like or customize the default LLM and other configurations, set the environment variable to true. Then, adjust your settings in the file. </details> Setup Local Models for local/private RAG See Local model setup. Setup multimodal document parsing OCR, table parsing, figure extraction These options are available: - Azure Document Intelligence API - Adobe PDF Extract API - Docling local, open-source - To use Docling, first install required dependencies: Select corresponding loaders in Customize your application - By default, all application data is stored in the folder. You can back up or copy this folder to transfer your installation to a new machine. - For advanced users or specific use cases, you can customize these files: - - This file contains the configuration of your application. You can use the example here as the starting point. <details> <summary>Notable settings</summary> </details> This file provides another way to configure your models and credentials. <details> <summary>Configure model via the .env file</summary> - Alternatively, you can configure the models via the file with the information needed to connect to the LLMs. This file is located in the folder of the application. If you don't see it, you can create one. - Currently, the following providers are supported: - OpenAI In the file, set the variable with your OpenAI API key in order to enable access to OpenAI's models. There are other variables that can be modified, please feel free to edit them to fit your case. Otherwise, the default parameter should work for most people. - Azure OpenAI For OpenAI models via Azure platform, you need to provide your Azure endpoint and API key. Your might also need to provide your developments' name for the chat model and the embedding model depending on how you set up Azure development. - Local Models - Using OpenAI compatible server: - Install ollama and start the application. - Pull your model, for example: - Set the model names on web UI and make it as default: !Models - Using with You can search and download a LLM to be ran locally from the Hugging Face Hub. Currently, these model formats are supported: - GGUF You should choose a model whose size is less than your device's memory and should leave about 2 GB. For example, if you have 16 GB of RAM in total, of which 12 GB is available, then you should choose a model that takes up at most 10 GB of RAM. Bigger models tend to give better generation but also take more processing time. Here are some recommendations and their size in memory: - Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF: around 2 GB Add a new LlamaCpp model with the provided model name on the web UI. </details> Adding your own RAG pipeline Custom Reasoning Pipeline 1. Check the default pipeline implementation in here. You can make quick adjustment to how the default QA pipeline work. 2. Add new implementation in and later include it in to enable it on the UI.
