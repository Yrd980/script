Once your fingers have learned to speak Vim, they don't want to speak anything else! It's simply a very effective way of navigating, creating and editing text.

The intention of this collaborative list is to: learn which programs/apps that you already use which you can enhance with Vim keybindings. Search in your browser with . discover new programs that support Vim keybindings. In the need for a new file manager? Why not get one that has Vim keybindings? be up-to-date and alive -- add new programs and extensions as they evolve! There are of course already lists like this one floating around on the internet see Acknowledgments. While they are great, the issue is that they are not up-to-date with the latest developments. There are Vim-emulator add-ons being developed all the time! This is why this collaborative list was created. yes, technically it is vi-like keybindings we talk about here, but most people know and Google for vim, thus vim is used here instead of vi. > !TIP > Tip: navigate this document easily by using GitHub's built-in Markdown Table of Contents in the top left corner: > <a href="" title="GitHub built-in Table of Contents for markdown files."><img src="img/githubmdtoc.png" width="256" alt="ToC"></a> Legend The following symbols and formattings are used with each list item to make it clearer what kind of Vim keybindings support exist: :whitecheckmark: - built-in support possibly via a setting :heavyplussign: - via addon/extension ~strikethrough~: deprecated or unsupported software Terminology: TUI - Text User Interface The Ultimate Vim Keybinding List Debuggers :whitecheckmark: cgdb - a curses interface on top of the GDB debuger with keybindings modeled after vim. :whitecheckmark: vimpdb - An integration of the python debugger and vim.
