caniuse-lite A smaller version of caniuse-db, with only the essentials! Why? The full data behind Can I use1 is incredibly useful for any front end developer, and on the website all of the details from the database are displayed to the user. However in automated tools, many of these fields go unused2; it's not a problem for server side consumption but client side, the less JavaScript that we send to the end user the better. caniuse-lite then, is a smaller dataset that keeps essential parts of the data in a compact format. It does this in multiple ways, such as converting array entries into empty strings, representing support data as an integer rather than a string, and using base62 references instead of longer human-readable keys. This packed data is then reassembled via functions exposed by this module into a larger format which is mostly compatible with caniuse-db, and so it can be used as an almost drop-in replacement for caniuse-db for contexts where size on disk is important; for example, usage in web browsers. The API differences are very small and are detailed in the section below. API caniuse-db provides a full file which contains all of the features data. Instead of this large file, caniuse-lite provides this data subset instead, which has the , , , and keys from the original. In addition, the subset contains the key with release dates as timestamps for each version: The method takes a file from and converts it into something that more closely represents the format. Note that only the , , , and keys are kept from the original data. The index is provided as a way to query all of the features that are listed in the dataset. Note that you will need to use the method on values from this index to get a human-readable format. The method takes a file from and converts it into something that more closely represents the format. Note that only the usage data is exposed here the key in the original files.
