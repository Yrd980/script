Anoma This is an implementation of the Anoma protocol, whose specs can be found here. Docs - Contributors documentation - Specification - Developer Docs Coming Soon™ - User Docs Coming Soon™ Following Development Work is merged into on a bi-weekly once every two weeks schedule. Development can be followed in multiple ways: 1. Issues are put into the project overview - This is a good way to see what work is assigned and the various views into how goals are being met 2. What's Cooking on Anoma 3. Research Forums - This is good for seeing discussions on the direction of Anoma - The architecture posts in particular are a practical vision for how the codebase's architecture will evolve. Around two of these get posted per week 4. Issues and pull requests - This is good for viewing new issues and work coming in, but the other views are typically a better way to view this Running pre-built binaries Release Dependencies To run a working Anoma Node the following dependencies are required: 1. Mac OS X Development Environment: Install Apple Command Line Developer Tools: Install MacPorts or equivalent package manager 2. Install ncurses Mac OS X only 3. Install OpenSSL: Mac OS X and Linux: use package manager Windows: not required Running Download the Anoma release for your platform, extract it, and run . Compilation from sources Build Dependencies Dependencies needed regardless of platform. - Elixir: consult the installation instructions here - Rust: consult the installation instructions here. - Protobuf: consult the installation instructions here - Elixir plugin for protobufs Note here that the version is important. After installing this plugin, ensure that it is available in your path. If you are using , call . If not, add to your or . Verify all is well. ---- MacOS Ensure Apple Command Line Developer Tools are installed. Using , install the following dependencies. --- Ubuntu/Debian Dependencies that you might not have installed. --- Windows - Install Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022 Workload: Visual C++ build tools - Install PowerShell --- Compiling and Running To install the dependencies as well as Anoma run: To start an Anoma instance run one of these: See the Contributing section for how to get the best use of the interactive shell. Further see the Known issues section if you encounter an issue. Docker images To work with Docker images, do the following: 1. Install Docker, this is necessary for both building and running Docker images 2. Build the Anoma image from the repository root: is your chosen image name 4. Run the Anoma image: is the name of Anoma Docker image to be run is interpreted by the Anoma binary will enable connections from the host Contributing Please read the contributor's guide for in depth details about the codebase. Known Issues Mix Could not compile dependency :enacl For some versions of OSX and Linux, our enacl package may have compilation issues. To get around it please run could not compile dependency :cairo, "mix compile" The rust compiler can be quite picky about our cairo dependencies. This is likely caused by an incompatible rust-toolchain. To get around it you may have to run a command like: Once this is had, the Cairo issues should go away. Git This codebase follows a git style similar to git or linux. New code should be based on , and no attempt to keep it up to sync with should be had. When one's topic is ready, just submit a PR on github and a maintainer will handle any merge conflicts. There are bi-weekly releases, so do not be afraid if a maintainer says the PR is merged but it's still open, this just means that it's merged into or and will be included in the next scheduled release.
