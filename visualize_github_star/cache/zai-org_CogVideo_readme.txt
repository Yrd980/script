SAT Please make sure your Python version is between 3.10 and 3.12, inclusive of both 3.10 and 3.12. Follow instructions in satdemo: Contains the inference code and fine-tuning code of SAT weights. It is recommended to improve based on the CogVideoX model structure. Innovative researchers use this code to better perform rapid stacking and development. Diffusers Please make sure your Python version is between 3.10 and 3.12, inclusive of both 3.10 and 3.12. Then follow diffusersdemo: A more detailed explanation of the inference code, mentioning the significance of common parameters. For more details on quantized inference, please refer to diffusers-torchao. With Diffusers and TorchAO, quantized inference is also possible leading to memory-efficient inference as well as speedup in some cases when compiled.

were enabled. This scheme has not been tested for actual memory usage on devices outside of NVIDIA A100 / H100 architectures. Generally, this scheme can be adapted to all NVIDIA Ampere architecture and above devices. If optimizations are disabled, memory consumption will multiply, with peak memory usage being about 3 times the value in the table. However, speed will increase by about 3-4 times. You can selectively disable some optimizations, including: + For multi-GPU inference, the optimization needs to be disabled. + Using INT8 models will slow down inference, which is done to accommodate lower-memory GPUs while maintaining minimal video quality loss, though inference speed will significantly decrease. + The CogVideoX-2B model was trained in precision, and all CogVideoX-5B models were trained in precision. We recommend using the precision in which the model was trained for inference. + PytorchAO and Optimum-quanto can be used to quantize the text encoder, transformer, and VAE modules to reduce the memory requirements of CogVideoX. This allows the model to run on free T4 Colabs or GPUs with smaller memory! Also, note that TorchAO quantization is fully compatible with , which can significantly improve inference speed. FP8 precision must be used on devices with NVIDIA H100 and above, requiring source installation of , Python packages. CUDA 12.4 is recommended. + The inference speed tests also used the above memory optimization scheme. Without memory optimization, inference speed increases by about 10%. Only the version of the model supports quantization. + The model only supports English input; other languages can be translated into English for use via large model refinement.
