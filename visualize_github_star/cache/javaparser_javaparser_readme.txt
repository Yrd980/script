Our main site is at JavaParser.org Sponsors Support this project by becoming a sponsor! Become a sponsor. Your donation will help the project live and grow successfully. Javaparser uses OpenCollective to gather money. Thank you to our sponsors! Setup The project binaries are available in Maven Central. We strongly advise users to adopt Maven, Gradle or another build system for their projects. If you are not familiar with them we suggest taking a look at the maven quickstart projects javaparser-maven-sample, javasymbolsolver-maven-sample. Just add the following to your maven configuration or tailor to your own dependency management system. Please refer to the Migration Guide when upgrading from 2.5.1 to 3.0.0+ Maven: Gradle: Since Version 3.5.10, the JavaParser project includes the JavaSymbolSolver. While JavaParser generates an Abstract Syntax Tree, JavaSymbolSolver analyzes that AST and is able to find the relation between an element and its declaration e.g. for a variable name it could be a parameter of a method, providing information about its type, position in the AST, ect. Using the dependency above will add both JavaParser and JavaSymbolSolver to your project. If you only need the core functionality of parsing Java source code in order to traverse and manipulate the generated AST, you can reduce your projects boilerplate by only including JavaParser to your project: Maven: Gradle: Since version 3.6.17 the AST can be serialized to JSON. There is a separate module for this: Maven: Gradle: How To Compile Sources If you checked out the project's source code from GitHub, you can build the project with maven using: If you want to generate the packaged jar files from the source files, you run the following maven command: NOTE the jar files for the two modules can be found in: - - If you checkout the sources and want to view the project in an IDE, it is best to first generate some of the source files; otherwise you will get many compilation complaints in the IDE. already does this for you. If you modify the code of the AST nodes, specifically if you add or remove fields or node classes, the code generators will update a lot of code for you. The script will rebuild the metamodel, which is used by the code generators which are run by Make sure that at least compiles before you run these.
