Split APKs Installer SAI: !Crowdinhttps://polychromaticfox.crowdin.com/split-apks-installer Filepicker lib: !Crowdinhttps://polychromaticfox.crowdin.com/sai-filepicker SAI Split APKs Installer is an Android app that lets you install split APKs such as ones distributed as Android App Bundle. It has both rooted and rootless installation methods. <img src="https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="80"> <img src="https://play.google.com/intl/enus/badges/images/generic/en-play-badge.png" alt="Get it on Google Play" height="80"> State of SAI SAI is kinda dead cause I have no motivation for continuing its development. I will probably maybe still occasionally fix bugs and add small features/improvements, focusing on the installer functionality, but idk. If you're looking for an actual backup solution, you can try OAndBackupX or Swift Backup.
