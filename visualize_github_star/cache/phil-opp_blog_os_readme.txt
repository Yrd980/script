Blog OS This repository contains the source code for the Writing an OS in Rust series at os.phil-opp.com. If you have questions, open an issue or chat with us on Gitter. Where is the code? The code for each post lives in a separate git branch. This makes it possible to see the intermediate state after each post. The code for the latest post is available herelatest-post. latest-post: https://github.com/phil-opp/blogos/tree/post-12 You can find the branch for each post by following the link in the post list below. The branches are named where is the post number, for example for the VGA Text Mode post or for the Hardware Interrupts post. For build instructions, see the Readme of the respective branch. You can check out a branch in a subdirectory using git worktree: git worktree: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree The above command creates a subdirectory named that contains the code for the 10th post "Heap Allocation". Posts The goal of this project is to provide step-by-step tutorials in individual blog posts. We currently have the following set of posts: Bare Bones: - A Freestanding Rust Binary source code - A Minimal Rust Kernel source code - VGA Text Mode source code - Testing source code Interrupts: - CPU Exceptions source code - Double Faults source code - Hardware Interrupts source code Memory Management: - Introduction to Paging source code - Paging Implementation source code - Heap Allocation source code - Allocator Designs source code Multitasking: - Async/Await source code First Edition Posts The current version of the blog is already the second edition. The first edition is outdated and no longer maintained, but might still be useful.
