They all share same configuration approaches and general design principles. Think about this project as "Swiss Army knife" among Neovim plugins: it has many different independent tools modules suitable for most common tasks. Each module can be used separately without any startup and usage overhead. If you want to help this project grow but don't know where to start, check out contributing guides or leave a Github star for 'mini.nvim' project and/or any its standalone Git repositories. Table of contents - Installation - Modules - General principles - Plugin colorschemes - Planned modules Installation There are two branches to install from: - default, recommended will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled. - will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in branch. Here are code snippets for some common installation methods: - Manually with compatible with mini.deps: - With folke/lazy.nvim: | Branch | Code snippet | |--------|-------------------------------------------------| | Main | | | Stable | | - With junegunn/vim-plug: | Branch | Code snippet | |--------|--------------------------------------------------------| | Main | | | Stable | | - Every module is also distributed as a standalone Git repository. Check out module's information for more details. Important: don't forget to call module's if required to enable its functionality. Note: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths like . Try doing one of the following: - Enable corresponding git global config value: . Then try to reinstall. - Install plugin in other place with shorter path. Modules 'mini.nvim' contains many modules which is slightly daunting at first. All of them can be used independently, one at a time. For easier exploration, here they are presented in groups based on module's primary functionality although some modules can fit in several groups.

Each module is designed to solve a particular problem targeting balance between feature-richness handling as many edge-cases as possible and simplicity of implementation/support. Granted, not all of them ended up with the same balance, but it is the goal nevertheless. - Independence. Modules are independent of each other and can be run without external dependencies. Although some of them may need dependencies for full experience. - Structure. Each module is a submodule for a placeholder "mini" module. So, for example, "surround" module should be referred to as "mini.surround". As later will be explained, this plugin can also be referred to as "MiniSurround". - Setup: - Each module you want to use should be enabled separately with . Possibly replace with your config table or omit altogether to use defaults. You can supply only parts of config, the rest will be inferred from defaults. - Call to module's always creates a global Lua object with coherent camel-case name: creates . This allows for a simpler usage of plugin functionality: instead of use or manually in command line; available from like . Considering this, "module" and "Lua object" names can be used interchangeably: 'mini.surround' and 'MiniSurround' will mean the same thing. - Each supplied table is stored in field of global object. Like . - Values of which affect runtime activity can be changed on the fly to have effect. For example, can be changed during runtime; but changing won't have any effect as mappings are created once during . - If module works best with some specific non-default option value, it is set during . If the value is not essential to module's functionality, it is done only if user or another plugin hasn't set it beforehand no matter the value. - Buffer local configuration. Each module can be additionally configured to use certain runtime config settings locally to buffer. See section in help file for more information. - Buffer names. All module-related buffers are named according to the following format: forward slashes are used on any platform; may be empty. This structure allows creating identifiable, reasonably unique, and useful buffer names. For example, 'mini.files' buffers are created per displayed directory/file with names like . - Disabling. Each module's core functionality can be disabled globally or locally to buffer. See "Disabling" section in module's help page for more details. See section in main help file for common recipes. - Silencing. Each module providing non-error feedback can be configured to not do that by setting either inside call or on the fly. - Highlighting. Appearance of module's output is controlled by certain set of highlight groups see . By default they usually link to some semantically close built-in highlight group and are ensured to be defined after any color scheme takes effect. Use command or Lua function to customize highlighting. To see a more calibrated look, use 'mini.hues', 'mini.base16', or plugin's color scheme. - Stability. Each module upon release is considered to be relatively stable: both in terms of setup and functionality. Any non-bugfix backward-incompatible change will be released gradually as much as possible. - Not filetype/language specific. Including functionality which needs several filetype/language specific implementations is an explicit no-goal of this project. This is mostly due to the potential increase in maintenance to keep implementation up to date. However, any part which might need filetype/language specific tuning should be designed to allow it by letting user set proper buffer options and/or local configuration. Plugin color schemes This plugin comes with several color schemes all have both dark and light variants. Activate any of them as a regular like or . - Based on 'mini.hues' recommended: - : "icy winter" palette with azure background. - : "blooming spring" palette with green background. - : "hot summer" palette with brown/yellow background. - : "cooling autumn" palette with purple background. - : random background and foreground of the same hue with medium saturation. You can see how they look in 'mini.hues' README. - Based on 'mini.base16': - : cyan and grey main colors with medium contrast and saturation palette. - : blue and yellow main colors with high contrast and saturation palette. You can see how they look in 'mini.base16' README. Planned modules This is the list of modules I currently intend to implement eventually as my free time and dedication will allow, in alphabetical order: - 'mini.abbrev' - helper to manage/setup Insert mode abbreviations. - 'mini.cmdline' - improved Command line. Possibly with custom implementation. - 'mini.cycle' - cycle through alternatives with pre-defined rules. Something like monaqa/dial.nvim and AndrewRadev/switch.vim - 'mini.folds' - more capable and user-friendly folds. - 'mini.repl' - extendable wrapper for REPLs with built-in support for R, Python, Julia, and maybe just maybe some AI tools. - 'mini.sendtext' - send text between buffers. In particular between regular and built-in terminal buffers. - 'mini.statuscolumn' - customizable 'statuscolumn'. - 'mini.terminals' - coherently manage interactive terminal buffers. Something like kassio/neoterm. Might also incorporate functionality to asynchronously run code in shell with post-processed results. - 'mini.quickfix' - more capable and user-friendly quickfix list. Possibly with preview and inline editing for search-and-replace workflow. - 'mini.windows' - window manager. Interactive picker, layout organizer, and maybe more.
