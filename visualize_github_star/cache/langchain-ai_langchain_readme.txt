Check out LangChain.js. LangChain is a framework for building LLM-powered applications. It helps you chain together interoperable components and third-party integrations to simplify AI application development — all while future-proofing decisions as the underlying technology evolves. To learn more about LangChain, check out the docs. If you’re looking for more advanced customization or agent orchestration, check out LangGraph, our framework for building controllable agent workflows. Why use LangChain? LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more. Use LangChain for: - Real-time data augmentation. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external / internal systems, drawing from LangChain’s vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more. - Model interoperability. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application’s needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly — LangChain’s abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum. LangChain’s ecosystem While the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM applications. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with: - LangSmith - Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time. - LangGraph - Build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop workflows — and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna, and GitLab. - LangGraph Platform - Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in LangGraph Studio.
