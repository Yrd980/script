Nwg-look is a GTK settings editor, designed to work properly in wlroots-based Wayland environment. The look and feel is strongly influenced by LXAppearance, but nwg-look is intended to free the user from a few inconveniences: - It works natively on Wayland. You no longer need Xwayland, nor strange env variables for it to run. - It applies gsettings directly, with no need to use workarounds. You don't need to set gsettings in the sway config file. You don't need the script. !nwg-look Dependencies - go build dependency - gtk3 - xcur2png - gsettings Depending on your distro, you may also need to install gotk3 dependencies. Installation !Packaging statushttps://repology.org/project/nwg-look/versions If nwg-look has not yet been packaged for your Linux distribution: 1. Clone the repository, cd into it. 2. 3. Usage The flag has been added just in case. When you press the "Apply" button, in addition to applying the changes, a backup file is also created. You may apply gsetting again w/o running the GUI, by just . No idea if it's going to be useful in real life. ; Usage in sway The default way to apply GTK setting on sway Wayland compositor has been described in the GTK 3 settings on Wayland Wiki section. You no longer need it. Nwg-look loads and saves gsettings values directly, and does not care about the file. It only exports your settings to it, unless you use the flag. Therefore, if your sway config file contains either or if you use the script: to parse and apply the settings.ini file, remove these lines. Backward compatibility Some gsetting keys have no direct counterparts in the Gtk.Settings type. While exporting the settings.ini file, nwg-look uses the most similar values: | gsettings | Gtk.Settings | | --------- | ------------ | | | | | | | | | | Some Other settings have been left just for LXAppearance compatibility, and possible use of your settings.ini file elsewhere: - Toolbar style - Toolbar icon size have been deprecated since GTK 3.10, and the values are ignored. - Show button images - Show menu images have been deprecated since GTK 3.10, and have no corresponding gsettings values. - Enable event sounds - Enable input feedback sounds don't seem to change anything in non-GNOME environment.
