Windows Installers are the easiest way to get started and come with an optional automatic update functionality: - Windows .msi Installer x86-64 - Windows .msi Installer ARM 64 If you don't like installers, you can also use a portable version that is packaged as an archive: - Windows .zip Portable x86-64 - Windows .zip Portable ARM 64 Alternatively, you can also use the following package managers: - choco to install it with . - winget to install it with . macOS Installers are the easiest way to get started and come with an optional automatic update functionality: - MacOS .pkg Installer x86-64 - MacOS .pkg Installer ARM 64 If you don't like installers, you can also use a portable version that is packaged as an archive: - MacOS .dmg Portable x86-64 - MacOS .dmg Portable ARM 64 Alternatively, you can also use Homebrew to install XPipe with . Linux You can install XPipe the fastest by pasting the installation command into your terminal. This will perform the setup automatically. The script supports installation via , , , , , and on Linux: Of course, there are also other installation methods available. Debian-based distros The following debian installers are available: - Linux .deb Installer x86-64 - Linux .deb Installer ARM 64 Note that you should use apt to install the package with as other package managers, for example dpkg, are not able to resolve and install any dependency packages. RHEL-based distros The rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc. You can import it via to allow your rpm-based package manager to verify the release signature. The following rpm installers are available: - Linux .rpm Installer x86-64 - Linux .rpm Installer ARM 64 The same applies here, you should use a package manager that supports resolving and installing required dependencies if needed. Arch There is an official AUR package available that you can either install manually or via an AUR helper such as with . NixOS There's an official xpipe nixpkg available that you can install with . This one is however not always up to date. There is also a custom repository that contains the latest up-to-date releases: https://github.com/xpipe-io/nixpkg. You can install XPipe by following the instructions in the linked repository. Portable In case you prefer to use an archive version that you can extract anywhere, you can use these: - Linux .tar.gz Portable x86-64 - Linux .tar.gz Portable ARM 64 Alternatively, there are also AppImages available: - Linux .AppImage Portable x86-64 - Linux .AppImage Portable ARM 64 Note that the portable version assumes that you have some basic packages for graphical systems already installed as it is not a perfect standalone version. It should however run on most systems. Docker container XPipe is a desktop application first and foremost. It requires a full desktop environment to function with various installed applications such as terminals, editors, shells, CLI tools, and more. So there is no true web-based interface for XPipe. Since it might make sense however to access your XPipe environment from the web, there is also a so-called webtop docker container image for XPipe. XPipe Webtop is a web-based desktop environment that can be run in a container and accessed from a browser via KasmVNC. The desktop environment comes with XPipe and various terminals and editors preinstalled and configured. Further information Open source model XPipe follows an open core model, which essentially means that the main application is open source while certain other components are not. This mainly concerns the features only available in the homelab/professional plan and the shell handling library implementation. Furthermore, some CI pipelines and tests that run on private servers are also not included in the open repository. The distributed XPipe application consists out of two parts: - The open-source core that you can find this repository. It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. - The closed-source extensions, mostly for homelab/professional plan features, which are not included in this repository Additional features are available in the homelab/professional plan.
