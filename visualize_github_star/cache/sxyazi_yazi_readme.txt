It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience. üí° A new article explaining its internal workings: Why is Yazi Fast? - üöÄ Full Asynchronous Support: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources. - üí™ Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment. - üñºÔ∏è Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols: Also integrated with √úberzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals. - üåü Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading. - üîå Concurrent Plugin System: UI plugins rewriting most of the UI, functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua. - üì° Data Distribution Service: Built on a client-server architecture no additional server process required, integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence. - üì¶ Package Manager: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version. - üß∞ Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide - üí´ Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths - üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc. - üîÑ Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, Git Integration, Mount Manager - üé® Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, Virtual Filesystem, CSI u, OSC 52 - ... and more! https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/assets/17523360/92ff23fa-0cd5-4f04-b387-894c12265cc7 Project status Public beta, can be used as a daily driver. Yazi is currently in heavy development, expect breaking changes.
