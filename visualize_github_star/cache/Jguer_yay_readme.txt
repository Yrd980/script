Source The initial installation of Yay can be done by cloning the PKGBUILD and building with makepkg: We make sure we have the package group installed. If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so: Binary If you do not want to compile yay yourself you can use the builds generated by GitHub Actions. If you want to do all of this at once, we can chain the commands like so: Other distributions If you're using Manjaro or another distribution that packages you can simply install yay using pacman as root: > !WARNING > distributions sometimes lag updating yay on their repositories. First Use Development packages upgrade - Use to generate a development package database for packages that were installed without yay. This command should only be run once. - will then check for development package updates - Use to make development package updates permanently enabled and will then always check dev packages Examples of Custom Operations | Command | Description | | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | Alias to . | | | Present package-installation selection menu. | | | Install dependencies and build a local PKGBUILD. | | | Download PKGBUILD from ABS or AUR. yay v12.0+ | | | Print to stdout PKGBUILD from ABS or AUR. | | | Print system statistics. | | | Perform system upgrade, but also check for development package updates. | | | Perform system upgrade and use PKGBUILD modification time not version number to determine update. | | | Unvote for package Requires setting and environment variables yay v11.3+ | | | Vote for package Requires setting and environment variables. yay v11.3+ | | | Make combined upgrade the default mode. | | | Generate development package database used for devel update. | | | Clean unneeded dependencies. | Frequently Asked Questions - Yay does not display colored output. How do I fix it? Make sure you have the option in your see issue 123. - Sometimes diffs are printed to the terminal, and other times they are paged via less. How do I fix this? Yay uses to display diffs, which by default tells less not to page if the output can fit into one terminal length. This behavior can be overridden by exporting your own flags . - Yay is not asking me to edit PKGBUILDS, and I don't like the diff menu! What can I do? - How can I tell Yay to act only on AUR packages, or only on repo packages? - A message is displayed. Why doesn't Yay update them? This message does not mean that updated AUR packages are available. It means the packages have been flagged out of date on the AUR, but their maintainers have not yet updated the s see outdated AUR packages. - Yay doesn't install dependencies added to a PKGBUILD during installation. Yay resolves all dependencies ahead of time. You are free to edit the PKGBUILD in any way, but any problems you cause are your own and should not be reported unless they can be reproduced with the original PKGBUILD. - I know my package has updates but yay doesn't offer to update it Yay uses a hash cache for development packages. Normally it is updated at the end of the package install with the message . If you transition between aur helpers and did not install the devel package using yay at some point, it is possible it never got added to the cache. will fix the current version of every devel package and start checking from there. - I want to help out! Check CONTRIBUTING.md for more information. Support All support related to Yay should be requested via GitHub issues. Since Yay is not officially supported by Arch Linux, support should not be sought out on the forums, AUR comments or other official channels. A broken AUR package should be reported as a comment on the package's AUR page. A package may only be considered broken if it fails to build with makepkg. Reports should be made using makepkg and include the full output as well as any other relevant information. Never make reports using Yay or any other external tools.
