Visit the Quickstart to get up and running. Use with your existing broadcasting software In general, Owncast is compatible with any software that uses to broadcast to a remote server. is what all the major live streaming services use, so if you’re currently using one of those it’s likely that you can point your existing software at your Owncast instance instead. OBS, Streamlabs, Restream and many others have been used with Owncast. Read more about compatibility with existing software. Building from Source Owncast consists of two projects. 1. The Owncast backend is written in Go. 1. The frontend is written in React. Read more about running from source. Important note about source code and the develop branch The branch is always the most up-to-date state of development and this may not be what you always want. If you want to run the latest released stable version, check out the tag related to that release.
