Required: A little experience with coding variables, loops, methods/functions, etc Patience Time Note this is a study plan for software engineering, not frontend engineering or full-stack development. There are really super roadmaps and coursework for those career paths elsewhere see https://roadmap.sh/ for more info. There is a lot to learn in a university Computer Science program, but only knowing about 75% is good enough for an interview, so that's what I cover here.

If you want to work as a software engineer for a large company, these are the things you have to know. If you missed out on getting a degree in computer science, like I did, this will catch you up and save four years of your life. When I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, or anything about trees, or how to traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it would have been terrible. Every data structure I had ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked under the hood at all. I never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an "out of memory" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and thousands of associative arrays, but I never created data structures from scratch. It's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time. ⬆ back to top How to use it Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom. I'm using GitHub's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to track progress. - More about GitHub-flavored markdown If you don't want to use git On this page, click the Code button near the top, then click "Download ZIP". Unzip the file and you can work with the text files. If you're open in a code editor that understands markdown, you'll see everything formatted nicely. !How to download the repo as a zip file If you're comfortable with git Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: x 1. Fork the GitHub repo: by clicking on the Fork button. !Fork the GitHub repo 1. Clone to your local repo: 1. Mark all boxes with X after you completed your changes: ⬆ back to top Don't feel you aren't smart enough - Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough. - The following videos may help you overcome this insecurity: - The myth of the Genius Programmer - It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech ⬆ back to top A Note About Video Resources Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. These are called MOOCs. Sometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access. It would be great to replace the online course resources with free and always-available public sources, such as YouTube videos preferably university lectures, so that you people can study these anytime, not just when a specific online course is in session. ⬆ back to top Choose a Programming Language You'll need to choose a programming language for the coding interviews you do, but you'll also need to find a language that you can use to study computer science concepts. Preferably the language would be the same, so that you only need to be proficient in one. For this Study Plan When I did the study plan, I used 2 languages for most of it: C and Python C: Very low level. Allows you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures and algorithms in your bones. In higher-level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day-to-day work, that's terrific, but when you're learning how these low-level data structures are built, it's great to feel close to the metal. - C is everywhere. You'll see examples in books, lectures, videos, everywhere while you're studying. - The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition - This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work. - You don't need to go super deep in the book or even finish it. Just get to where you're comfortable reading and writing in C. Python: Modern and very expressive, I learned it because it's just super useful and also allows me to write less code in an interview. This is my preference. You do what you like, of course. You may not need it, but here are some sites for learning a new language: - Exercism - Codewars - HackerEarth - Scaler Topics Java, C++ - Programiz PRO Community Challenges For your Coding Interview You can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for large companies, these are solid choices: - C++ - Java - Python You could also use these, but read around first. There may be caveats: - JavaScript - Ruby Here is an article I wrote about choosing a language for the interview: Pick One Language for the Coding Interview. This is the original article my post was based on: Choosing a Programming Language for Interviews You need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable. Read more about choices: - Choose the Right Language for Your Coding Interview See language-specific resources here ⬆ back to top Books for Data Structures and Algorithms This book will form your foundation for computer science. Just choose one, in a language that you will be comfortable with. You'll be doing a lot of reading and coding.

Here are some mistakes I made so you'll have a better experience. And you'll save months of time. 1. You Won't Remember it All I watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was much I didn't remember. I spent 3 days going through my notes and making flashcards, so I could review. I didn't need all of that knowledge. Please, read so you won't make my mistakes: Retaining Computer Science Knowledge. 2. Use Flashcards To solve the problem, I made a little flashcard site where I could add flashcards of 2 types: general and code. Each card has a different formatting. I made a mobile-first website, so I could review on my phone or tablet, wherever I am. Make your own for free: - Flashcards site repo I DON'T RECOMMEND using my flashcards. There are too many and most of them are trivia that you don't need. But if you don't want to listen to me, here you go: - My flash cards database 1200 cards: - My flash cards database extreme - 1800 cards: Keep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics. It's way too much for what's required. Note on flashcards: The first time you recognize you know the answer, don't mark it as known. You have to see the same card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in your brain. An alternative to using my flashcard site is Anki, which has been recommended to me numerous times. It uses a repetition system to help you remember. It's user-friendly, available on all platforms, and has a cloud sync system. It costs $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms. My flashcard database in Anki format: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560 thanks @xiewenya. Some students have mentioned formatting issues with white space that can be fixed by doing the following: open the deck, edit the card, click cards, select the "styling" radio button, and add the member "white-space: pre;" to the card class. 3. Do Coding Interview Questions While You're Learning THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. Start doing coding interview questions while you're learning data structures and algorithms. You need to apply what you're learning to solve problems, or you'll forget. I made this mistake. Once you've learned a topic, and feel somewhat comfortable with it, for example, linked lists: 1. Open one of the coding interview books or coding problem websites, listed below 1. Do 2 or 3 questions regarding linked lists. 1. Move on to the next learning topic. 1. Later, go back and do another 2 or 3 linked list problems. 1. Do this with each new topic you learn. Keep doing problems while you're learning all this stuff, not after. You're not being hired for knowledge, but how you apply the knowledge. There are many resources for this, listed below. Keep going. 4. Focus There are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard. Turn on some music without lyrics and you'll be able to focus pretty well. ⬆ back to top What you won't see covered These are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan: - Javascript - HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies - SQL ⬆ back to top The Daily Plan This course goes over a lot of subjects. Each will probably take you a few days, or maybe even a week or more. It depends on your schedule. Each day, take the next subject in the list, watch some videos about that subject, and then write an implementation of that data structure or algorithm in the language you chose for this course. You can see my code here: - C - C++ - Python You don't need to memorize every algorithm. You just need to be able to understand it enough to be able to write your own implementation. ⬆ back to top Coding Question Practice Why is this here? I'm not ready to interview. Then go back and read this. Why you need to practice doing programming problems: - Problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in - Gathering requirements for the problem - Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview - Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer - Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions see Big-O below - Testing your solutions There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem-solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming interview books, too, but I found this outstanding: Algorithm design canvas Write code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then type it and test it out on a computer. If you don't have a whiteboard at home, pick up a large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice. This is my "sofa whiteboard". I added the pen in the photo just for scale. If you use a pen, you'll wish you could erase. Gets messy quickly. I use a pencil and eraser. !my sofa whiteboard Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems. ⬆ back to top Coding Problems Don't forget your key coding interview books here.

A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations to move any accessed key to the root." - Skiena - Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code - Splay tree: insert, search, delete functions If you end up implementing a red/black tree try just these: - Search and insertion functions, skipping delete - I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets - Self-balancing binary search tree - AVL trees - In practice: From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be: The AVL tree is another structure supporting Olog n search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language dictionaries or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter - MIT AVL Trees / AVL Sort video - AVL Trees video - AVL Tree Implementation video - Split And Merge - Review AVL Trees playlist in 19 minutes videohttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV5YoZOUFgdIeOPuH6cfSnNRMau- - Splay trees - In practice: Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors, data compression, ropes replacement of string used for long text strings, in Windows NT in the virtual memory, networking and file system code etc - CS 61B: Splay Trees video - MIT Lecture: Splay Trees: - Gets very mathy, but watch the last 10 minutes for sure. - Video - Red/black trees - These are a translation of a 2-3 tree see below. - In practice: Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time. Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures that provide worst-case guarantees; for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red-black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In version 8 of Java, the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used - Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 4 link jumps to the starting point video - Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 5 video - Red-Black Tree - An Introduction To Binary Search And Red Black Tree - Review Red-Black Trees playlist in 30 minutes videohttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV5YoZNqDI8qfOZgzbqahCUmUEin - 2-3 search trees - In practice: 2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches since height is more compared to AVL trees. - You would use 2-3 trees very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red-Black trees. - 23-Tree Intuition and Definition video - Binary View of 23-Tree - 2-3 Trees student recitation video - 2-3-4 Trees aka 2-4 trees - In practice: For every 2-4 trees, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an important tool for understanding the logic behind red-black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce 2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though 2-4 trees are not often used in practice. - CS 61B Lecture 26: Balanced Search Trees video - Bottom Up 234-Trees video - Top Down 234-Trees video - N-ary K-ary, M-ary trees - note: the N or K is the branching factor max branches - binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2 - 2-3 trees are 3-ary - K-Ary Tree - B-Trees - Fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer co-inventor. - In Practice: B-trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees or Variants. In addition to its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block address into a disk block or perhaps to a cylinder head sector address - B-Tree - B-Tree Datastructure - Introduction to B-Trees video - B-Tree Definition and Insertion video - B-Tree Deletion video - MIT 6.851 - Memory Hierarchy Models video - covers cache-oblivious B-Trees, very interesting data structures - the first 37 minutes are very technical, and may be skipped B is block size, cache line size - Review B-Trees playlist in 26 minutes videohttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV5YoZNFPPv98DjTdD9X6UI9KMHz - k-D Trees - Great for finding a number of points in a rectangle or higher-dimensional object - A good fit for k-nearest neighbors - kNN K-d tree algorithm video - Skip lists - "These are somewhat of a cult data structure" - Skiena - Randomization: Skip Lists video - For animations and a little more detail - Network Flows - Ford-Fulkerson in 5 minutes — Step by step example video - Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm video - Network Flows video - Disjoint Sets & Union Find - UCB 61B - Disjoint Sets; Sorting & selection video - Sedgewick Algorithms - Union-Find 6 videos - Math for Fast Processing - Integer Arithmetic, Karatsuba Multiplication video - The Chinese Remainder Theorem used in cryptography video - Treap - Combination of a binary search tree and a heap - Treap - Data Structures: Treaps explained video - Applications in set operations - Linear Programming videos - Linear Programming - Finding minimum cost - Finding maximum value - Solve Linear Equations with Python - Simplex Algorithm - Geometry, Convex hull videos - Graph Alg.
