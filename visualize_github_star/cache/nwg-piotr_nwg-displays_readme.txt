Nwg-displays is an output management utility for sway and Hyprland Wayland compositor, inspired by wdisplays and wlay. The program is expected to: - provide an intuitive GUI to manage multiple displays; - apply settings; - save outputs configuration to a text file; - save workspace -> output assignments to a text file; - support sway and Hyprland only. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20579136/158013748-5b27f742-0e6a-4d82-a5ac-06368b4df008.png" width=640, alt="screenshot"><br> Installation Install from your linux distribution repository if possible. !Packaging statushttps://repology.org/project/nwg-displays/versions Otherwise, clone this repository and run the script. Dependencies - gtk-layer-shell - gtk3 - python - python-gobject - python-i3ipc - python-build make - python-installer make - python-setuptools make - python-wheel make Usage sway The configuration saved to a file may be easily used in the sway config: The program also saves the file, which defines the workspace -> output associations. You may include it in the sway config file, instead of editing associations manually: Use if your output names happen to be different on every restart, e.g. when you use Thunderbolt outputs. Use if you use workspaces in a number other than 8. Hyprland Monitors: Instead of configuring as described in Wiki, insert this line: Default workspace and Binding workspaces to a monitor: Insert: Do not set in Hyprland settings, or you'll have to reload Hyprland manually after applying chages. Settings The runtime configuration file is placed in your config directory, like . It's a simple JSON file: - does not need to be changed manually. The GUI takes care of that. - specifies the flush margin of widgets representing displays. I added this value just in case, as I have no high-DPI display to test the stuff on. - determines how long in milliseconds the overlay identifying screens should be visible. Set 0 to turn overlays off.
