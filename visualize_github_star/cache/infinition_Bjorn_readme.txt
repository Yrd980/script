This document provides a detailed explanation of the project. 📚 Table of Contents - Introduction - Features - Getting Started - Prerequisites - Installation - Quick Start - Usage Example - Contributing - License - Contact 📄 Introduction Bjorn is a powerful tool designed to perform comprehensive network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and data ex-filtration. Its modular design and extensive configuration options allow for flexible and targeted operations. By combining different actions and orchestrating them intelligently, Bjorn can provide valuable insights into network security and help identify and mitigate potential risks. The e-Paper HAT display and web interface make it easy to monitor and interact with Bjorn, providing real-time updates and status information. With its extensible architecture and customizable actions, Bjorn can be adapted to suit a wide range of security testing and monitoring needs. 🌟 Features - Network Scanning: Identifies live hosts and open ports on the network. - Vulnerability Assessment: Performs vulnerability scans using Nmap and other tools. - System Attacks: Conducts brute-force attacks on various services FTP, SSH, SMB, RDP, Telnet, SQL. - File Stealing: Extracts data from vulnerable services. - User Interface: Real-time display on the e-Paper HAT and web interface for monitoring and interaction. !Bjorn Display 🚀 Getting Started 📌 Prerequisites 📋 Prerequisites for RPI zero W 32bits !image - Raspberry Pi OS installed. - Stable: - System: 32-bit - Kernel version: 6.6 - Debian version: 12 bookworm '2024-10-22-raspios-bookworm-armhf-lite' - Username and hostname set to . - 2.13-inch e-Paper HAT connected to GPIO pins. 📋 Prerequisites for RPI zero W2 64bits !image I did not develop Bjorn for the raspberry pi zero w2 64bits, but several feedbacks have attested that the installation worked perfectly. - Raspberry Pi OS installed. - Stable: - System: 64-bit - Kernel version: 6.6 - Debian version: 12 bookworm '2024-10-22-raspios-bookworm-arm64-lite' - Username and hostname set to . - 2.13-inch e-Paper HAT connected to GPIO pins. At the moment the paper screen v2 v4 have been tested and implemented. I juste hope the V1 & V3 will work the same. 🔨 Installation The fastest way to install Bjorn is using the automatic installation script : For detailed information about installation process go to Install Guide ⚡ Quick Start Need help ? You struggle to find Bjorn's IP after the installation ? Use my Bjorn Detector & SSH Launcher : https://github.com/infinition/bjorn-detector !ezgif-1-a310f5fe8f Hmm, You still need help ? For detailed information about troubleshooting go to Troubleshooting Quick Installation: you can use the fastest way to install Bjorn Getting Started 💡 Usage Example Here's a demonstration of how Bjorn autonomously hunts through your network like a Viking raider fake demo for illustration: This is just a demo output - actual results will vary based on your network and target configuration. All discovered data is automatically organized in the data/output/ directory, viewable through both the e-Paper display as indicators and web interface. Bjorn works tirelessly, expanding its network knowledge base and growing stronger with each discovery. No constant monitoring needed - just deploy and let Bjorn do what it does best: hunt for vulnerabilities. 🔧 Expand Bjorn's Arsenal! Bjorn is designed to be a community-driven weapon forge.
