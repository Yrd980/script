Prompt Engineering Guide Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models LMs for a wide variety of applications and research topics. Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models LLMs. Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools. Motivated by the high interest in developing with LLMs, we have created this new prompt engineering guide that contains all the latest papers, learning guides, lectures, references, and tools related to prompt engineering for LLMs. 🌐 Prompt Engineering Guide Web Version 🎉 We are excited to launch our brand new prompt engineering courses under the DAIR.AI Academy.
