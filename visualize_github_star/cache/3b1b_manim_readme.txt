Note, there are two versions of manim. This repository began as a personal project by the author of 3Blue1Brown for the purpose of animating those videos, with video-specific code available here. In 2020 a group of developers forked it into what is now the community edition, with a goal of being more stable, better tested, quicker to respond to community contributions, and all around friendlier to get started with. See this page for more details. Installation > !Warning > WARNING: These instructions are for ManimGL only. Trying to use these instructions to install Manim Community/manim or instructions there to install this version will cause problems. You should first decide which version you wish to install, then only follow the instructions for your desired version. > !Note > Note: To install manim directly through pip, please pay attention to the name of the installed package. This repository is ManimGL of 3b1b. The package name is instead of or . Please use to install the version in this repository. Manim runs on Python 3.7 or higher. System requirements are FFmpeg, OpenGL and LaTeX optional, if you want to use LaTeX. For Linux, Pango along with its development headers are required. See instruction here. Directly For more options, take a look at the Using manim sections further below. If you want to hack on manimlib itself, clone this repository and in that directory execute: Directly Windows 1. Install FFmpeg. 2. Install a LaTeX distribution. MiKTeX is recommended. 3. Install the remaining Python packages. Mac OSX 1. Install FFmpeg, LaTeX in terminal using homebrew. 2. If you are using an ARM-based processor, install Cairo. 3. Install latest version of manim using these command. Anaconda Install 1. Install LaTeX as above. 2. Create a conda environment using . 3. Activate the environment using . 4. Install manimgl using . Using manim Try running the following: This should pop up a window playing a simple scene. Look through the example scenes to see examples of the library's syntax, animation types and object types. In the 3b1b/videos repo, you can see all the code for 3blue1brown videos, though code from older videos may not be compatible with the most recent version of manim. The readme of that repo also outlines some details for how to set up a more interactive workflow, as shown in this manim demo video for example. When running in the CLI, some useful flags include: to write the scene to a file to write the scene to a file and open the result to skip to the end and just show the final frame. will save the final frame to an image and show it to skip ahead to the 'th animation of a scene. to make the playback window fullscreen Take a look at customconfig.yml for further configuration. To add your customization, you can either edit this file, or add another file by the same name "customconfig.yml" to whatever directory you are running manim from. For example this is the one for 3blue1brown videos. There you can specify where videos should be output to, where manim should look for image files and sounds you want to read in, and other defaults regarding style and video quality. Documentation Documentation is in progress at 3b1b.github.io/manim. And there is also a Chinese version maintained by @manim-kindergarten: docs.manim.org.cn in Chinese. manim-kindergarten wrote and collected some useful extra classes and some codes of videos in manimsandbox repo. Contributing Is always welcome. As mentioned above, the community edition has the most active ecosystem for contributions, with testing and continuous integration, but pull requests are welcome here too.
