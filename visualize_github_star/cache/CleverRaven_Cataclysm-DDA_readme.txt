Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world. While some have described it as a "zombie game", there is far more to Cataclysm than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, who want what you have... <p align="center"> <img src="./data/screenshots/ultica-showcase-sep-2021.png" alt="Tileset: Ultica"> </p> Downloads Releases - Stable | Experimental Source - The source can be downloaded as a .zip archive, or cloned from our GitHub repo. !General build matrixhttps://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/actions/workflows/matrix.yml !Coverage Statushttps://coveralls.io/github/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA?branch=master !Open Source Helpershttps://www.codetriage.com/cleverraven/cataclysm-dda !Commit Activityhttps://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/graphs/contributors !Lines of Codehttps://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei !TODOshttps://www.tickgit.com/browse?repo=github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA Packaging status Arch Linux Ncurses and tiles versions are available in the community repos.
