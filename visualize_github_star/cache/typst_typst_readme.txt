Typst has: - Built-in markup for the most common formatting tasks - Flexible functions for everything else - A tightly integrated scripting system - Math typesetting, bibliography management, and more - Fast compile times thanks to incremental compilation - Friendly error messages in case something goes wrong This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you need to compile Typst documents locally. For the best writing experience, consider signing up to our collaborative online editorapp for free. Example A gentle introductiontutorial to Typst is available in our documentation. However, if you want to see the power of Typst encapsulated in one image, here it is: <p align="center"> <img alt="Example" width="900" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17899797/228031796-ced0e452-fcee-4ae9-92da-b9287764ff25.png"> </p> Let's dissect what's going on: - We use set rules to configure element properties like the size of pages or the numbering of headings. By setting the page height to , it scales to fit the content. Set rules accommodate the most common configurations. If you need full control, you can also use show rulesshow to completely redefine the appearance of an element. - We insert a heading with the syntax. One equals sign creates a top level heading, two create a subheading and so on. Typst has more lightweight markup like this, see the syntax reference for a full list. - Mathematical equationsmath are enclosed in dollar signs. By adding extra spaces around the contents of an equation, we can put it into a separate block. Multi-letter identifiers are interpreted as Typst definitions and functions unless put into quotes. This way, we don't need backslashes for things like and . And applies the modifier to the to select a particular symbol variant. - Now, we get to some scripting. To input code into a Typst document, we can write a hash followed by an expression. We define two variables and a recursive function to compute the n-th fibonacci number. Then, we display the results in a center-aligned table. The table function takes its cells row-by-row. Therefore, we first pass the formulas to and then the computed fibonacci numbers. We apply the spreading operator to both because they are arrays and we want to pass the arrays' items as individual arguments. <details> <summary>Text version of the code example.</summary> </details> Installation Typst's CLI is available from different sources: - You can get sources and pre-built binaries for the latest release of Typst from the releases pagereleases. Download the archive for your platform and place it in a directory that is in your . To stay up to date with future releases, you can simply run . - You can install Typst through different package managers. Note that the versions in the package managers might lag behind the latest release. - Linux: - View Typst on Repologyrepology - View Typst's Snapsnap - macOS: - Windows: - If you have a Rustrust toolchain installed, you can install - the latest released Typst version with - a development version with - Nix users can - use the package with - build and run a development version with . - Docker users can run a prebuilt image with . Usage Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this: You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental compilation. Typst further allows you to add custom font paths for your project and list all of the fonts it discovered: For other CLI subcommands and options, see below: If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant preview, you can also check out our free web appapp. Alternatively, there is a community-created language server called Tinymist which is integrated into various editor extensions. Community The main places where the community gathers are our Forumforum and our Discord serverdiscord. The Forum is a great place to ask questions, help others, and share cool things you created with Typst. The Discord server is more suitable for quicker questions, discussions about contributing, or just to chat. We'd be happy to see you there! Typst Universeuniverse is where the community shares templates and packages. If you want to share your own creations, you can submit them to our package repositorypackages. If you had a bad experience in our community, please reach out to uscontact. Contributing We love to see contributions from the community. If you experience bugs, feel free to open an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature or bug fix, please follow the steps outlined in the contribution guidecontributing. To build Typst yourself, first ensure that you have the latest stable Rustrust installed. Then, clone this repository and build the CLI with the following commands: The optimized binary will be stored in . Another good way to contribute is by sharing packagespackages with the community. Pronunciation and Spelling IPA: /taɪpst/. "Ty" like in Typesetting and "pst" like in Hipster. When writing about Typst, capitalize its name as a proper noun, with a capital "T". Design Principles All of Typst has been designed with three key goals in mind: Power, simplicity, and performance. We think it's time for a system that matches the power of LaTeX, is easy to learn and use, all while being fast enough to realize instant preview. To achieve these goals, we follow three core design principles: - Simplicity through Consistency: If you know how to do one thing in Typst, you should be able to transfer that knowledge to other things. If there are multiple ways to do the same thing, one of them should be at a different level of abstraction than the other. E.g. it's okay that and do the same thing because the former is just syntax sugar for the latter. - Power through Composability: There are two ways to make something flexible: Have a knob for everything or have a few knobs that you can combine in many ways. Typst is designed with the second way in mind. We provide systems that you can compose in ways we've never even thought of. TeX is also in the second category, but it's a bit low-level and therefore people use LaTeX instead. But there, we don't really have that much composability. Instead, there's a package for everything . - Performance through Incrementality: All Typst language features must accommodate for incremental compilation. Luckily we have , a system for incremental compilation which does most of the hard work in the background.
