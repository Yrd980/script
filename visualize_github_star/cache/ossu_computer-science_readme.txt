It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and most importantly! good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners. It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education non-CS requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS. The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc., but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria. Courses must: - Be open for enrollment - Run regularly ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year - Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles - Match the curricular standards of the CS 2013: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a book. When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality, they belong in extras/courses or extras/readings. Organization. The curriculum is designed as follows: - Intro CS: for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them - Core CS: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take - Advanced CS: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests - Final Project: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide Duration. It is possible to finish within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 20 hours/week to your studies. Learners can use this spreadsheet to estimate their end date. Make a copy and input your start date and expected hours per week in the sheet. As you work through courses you can enter your actual course completion dates in the sheet and get updated completion estimates. > Warning: While the spreadsheet is a useful tool to estimate the time you need to complete this curriculum, it may not always be up-to-date with the curriculum. Use the OSSU CS website or the repo to see what courses to do. Cost. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded. Note that both Coursera and edX offer financial aid. Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget; just remember that you can't purchase success! Process. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order. - We recommend doing all courses in Core CS, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously. - For simplicity, we recommend working through courses especially Core CS in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week. A popular option is to take the math courses in parallel with the introductory courses. Course prerequisites are listed to help you determine if you are prepared for a given course. - Courses in Advanced CS are electives. Choose one subject e.g. Advanced programming you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading. You can also create your own custom subject; the Discord community may provide feedback on your planned subject. Content policy. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to. Respect the code of conduct that you signed in the beginning of each course!

The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems. After you've completed Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, you should identify a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired. You can create something entirely new, or you can improve some tool/program that you use and wish were better. Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses. Here is a sample of options many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you: Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: Fullstack Open | 12 weeks | 15 hours/week | programming Modern Robotics Specialization | 26 weeks | 2-5 hours/week | freshman-level physics, linear algebra, calculus, linear ordinary differential equations Data Mining Specialization | 30 weeks | 2-5 hours/week | machine learning Big Data Specialization | 30 weeks | 3-5 hours/week | none Internet of Things Specialization | 30 weeks | 1-5 hours/week | strong programming Cloud Computing Specialization | 30 weeks | 2-6 hours/week | C++ programming Data Science Specialization | 43 weeks | 1-6 hours/week | none Functional Programming in Scala Specialization | 29 weeks | 4-5 hours/week | One year programming experience Game Design and Development with Unity 2020 Specialization | 6 months | 5 hours/week | programming, interactive design Congratulations After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Congratulations! What is next for you? The possibilities are boundless and overlapping: - Look for a job as a developer! - Check out the readings for classic books you can read that will sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge. - Join a local developer meetup e.g. via meetup.com. - Pay attention to emerging technologies in the world of software development: + Explore the actor model through Elixir, a new functional programming language for the web based on the battle-tested Erlang Virtual Machine! + Explore borrowing and lifetimes through Rust, a systems language which achieves memory- and thread-safety without a garbage collector! + Explore dependent type systems through Idris, a new Haskell-inspired language with unprecedented support for type-driven development. !keep learning Code of conduct OSSU's code of conduct. How to show your progress Fork the GitHub repo into your own GitHub account and put ✅ next to the stuff you've completed as you complete it. This can serve as your kanban board and will be faster to implement than any other solution giving you time to spend on the courses.
