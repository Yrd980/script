!MIT License !Tests Blazing fast indentation style detection for Neovim written in Lua. The goal of this plugin is to automatically detect the indentation style used in a buffer and updating the buffer options accordingly. This mimics the "Guess Indentation Settings From Buffer" function built into Sublime Text. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9914734/154780206-c60eda09-175d-4ee8-81be-2aea1fcaadf4.gif" style="width: 100%"> How it works Whenever you open a new buffer, guess-indent looks at the first few hundred lines and uses them to determine how the buffer should be indented. It then automatically updates the buffer options so that they match the opened file. Installation Install using your favorite package manager and then call the following setup function somewhere in your config: If you are using packer.nvim, you can install and set up guess-indent simultaneously: Usage By default, guess-indent automatically runs whenever you open a new buffer. You can also run it manually using the command. Configuration The plugin provides the following configuration options: Normally it should not be necessary to disable the automatic execution of guess-indent, because it usually takes less than a millisecond to run, even for large files.
