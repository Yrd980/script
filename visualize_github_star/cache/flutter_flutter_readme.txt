Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source. Documentation Install Flutter Flutter documentation Development wiki Contributing to Flutter For announcements about new releases, follow the flutter-announce@googlegroups.com mailing list. Our documentation also tracks breaking changes across releases. Terms of service The Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By downloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service: https://policies.google.com/terms For example, when installed from GitHub as opposed to from a prepackaged archive, the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the tool itself. This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded e.g. by running the command. About Flutter We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive, extensible and open development model, whether you're targeting iOS or Android, web, Windows, macOS, Linux or embedding it as the UI toolkit for a platform of your choice. Beautiful user experiences We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework. Flutter's layered architecture gives you control over every pixel on the screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full set of widgetswidget catalog that deliver pixel-perfect experiences whether you're building for iOS Cupertino or other platforms Material, along with support for customizing or creating entirely new visual components. <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/reflectly-hero-600px.png?raw=true" alt="Reflectly hero image"></p> Fast results Flutter is fast. It's powered by hardware-accelerated 2D graphics libraries like Skia which underpins Chrome and Android and Impeller. We architected Flutter to support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device. Flutter code is powered by the world-class Dart platform, which enables compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android, JavaScript and WebAssembly for the web, as well as Intel x64 and ARM for desktop devices. <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/dart-diagram-small.png?raw=true" alt="Dart diagram"></p> Productive development Flutter offers stateful hot reloadHot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state. !Hot reload animationHot reload Extensible and open model Flutter works with any development tool or none at all, and also includes editor plug-ins for both Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ / Android Studio. Flutter provides tens of thousands of packagesFlutter packages to speed your development, regardless of your target platform.
