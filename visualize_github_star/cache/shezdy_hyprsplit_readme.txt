hyprsplit awesome / dwm like workspaces for hyprland A complete rewrite of split-monitor-workspaces that attempts to fix the issues I experienced with it. Improvements include: - Workspaces on each monitor are determined by that monitor's ID - Ability to grab windows that get lost in invalid workspaces when disconnecting monitors - Dispatcher to swap all windows in active workspaces between two monitors - Better handling of workspace params. For example will work properly and select an empty workspace on the current monitor. Installation Requires Hyprland version >= Hyprpm Load plugins on startup by putting exec-once = hyprpm reload -n in your hyprland config. Manual Make sure you have the Hyprland headers installed see hyprland wiki If you are compiling for a numbered version of Hyprland, check for a commit pin in hyprpm.toml, and reset the plugin to the second hash in the pair. Compile the plugin: Finally add the following to your config , or run Configuration Options | name | description | type | default | |---|---|---|---| | numworkspaces | Number of workspaces on each monitor | int | 10 | | persistentworkspaces | if true, will make workspaces on each monitor persistent they will always exist and will not be destroyed when empty | bool | false | Dispatchers | Dispatcher | Description | Params | | ---------- | ----------- | ------ | | split:workspace | Replacement for | workspace | | split:movetoworkspace | Replacement for | workspace OR for a specific window | | split:movetoworkspacesilent | Replacement for | workspace OR for a specific window | | split:swapactiveworkspaces | Swaps all windows in active workspaces between two monitors | two monitors separated by a space | | split:grabroguewindows | Finds all windows that are in invalid workspaces and moves them to the current workspace. Useful when unplugging monitors. | none | Some of Hyprland's workspace parameters are treated differently by the plugin's dispatchers: - ,, or : number on current monitor - or : relative on current monitor, no looping - or : relative on current monitor, with looping - , : relative on current monitor, excluding empty workspaces, same as m+1 - : empty workspace on current monitor All other workspace params will be treated the same as however Hyprland normally treats them. If you are using hy3 you should use instead of , it has compatibility with hyprsplit. Example Config
