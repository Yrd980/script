Yes, you read that right—1 minute! 🕒 Publishing your React component is as easy as pie. Just head over to our publish page and share your creation with the world. Review Process When you publish a component, it follows this journey: 1. Initial State - Component is available via direct link and awaiting review 2. Posted State - Component has passed review and is available on your profile and via direct link 3. Featured State - Component is featured on the homepage and in public listings I Serafim personally review each component to ensure it meets our quality standards before featuring it. Quality Guidelines To get your component featured, ensure it follows these key principles: 1. Visual Quality - Component should be visually polished and provide real value to the community - Follow modern UI/UX practices 2. Code Structure - Follow the shadcn/ui pattern of separating component logic from demo content - Component file should contain only the reusable functionality - Demo file should showcase the component through props, not hardcoded content 3. Theming - Use CSS variables from shadcn's theme system see - Support both light and dark modes out of the box - Use the proper color variables e.g., Remember: Quality over quantity! We prioritize well-crafted, reusable components that follow these guidelines.

Happy coding! 🎉 📋 Component Guidelines We maintain high quality standards for components that appear on the homepage and in public listings. While all published components are immediately available via direct links, they go through a review process before being featured publicly. Review Process When you publish a component, it follows this journey: 1. Initial State - Component is available via direct link and awaiting review 2.

Visual Design - Component should be visually polished and provide value to the community - Follow modern UI/UX practices - Support both light and dark themes - Use consistent spacing and sizing 2. Code Structure - Follow the shadcn/ui pattern of separating component logic from demo content - Component file should contain only the reusable functionality - Demo file should showcase the component with realistic content - Use props for customization and content injection 3. Theming - Use CSS variables from shadcn's theme system see - Support both light and dark modes out of the box - Use variables for colors e.g., - Follow the naming convention for CSS variables 4. Accessibility - Include proper ARIA attributes - Support keyboard navigation - Maintain sufficient color contrast - Test with screen readers 5.
