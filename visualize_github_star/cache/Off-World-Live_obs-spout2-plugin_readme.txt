Spout2 Plugin for OBS Studio 64bit ========= This plugin enables the import and export of shared textures at high resolution to and from SPOUT2 compatible programs. Why Previously the only way to import shared textures from SPOUT was via the DirectShow interface or by screen-capturing the full-screen output of the program. The is limited to standard webcam resolutions and capped at and capturing the SpoutReceiver is both inefficient and limited by your current screen resolution. Previously, there was no way of outputting Spout video textures from OBS. This plugin implements the SPOUT2 SDK, creates an OBS Source from the SPOUT shared texture and a Spout output which sends the content of the OBS canvas to Spout. Please see installation and usage guide here Acknowledgements Thanks to the developer of OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin whose source helped greatly in getting my head around the OBS API.
