Sure! Just paste it right below the Natsumi Browser loader userChrome.css and you can use your own userchrome alongside Natsumi Browser. "Can I disable individual features?" You can disable some features using the configuration options. If that doesn't help, you can remove certain modules CSS files from the natsumi.css file. However, you will need to keep certain files preload, postload, natsumi-config for Natsumi to work properly. > !CAUTION > By modifying any part of Natsumi, you are responsible for any issues that may arise. If things do > break, I will most likely not offer support for it. > > If you installed Natsumi as part of another skin, your installation may be considered modified. > Please check with the skin's developer for assistance in this case. "Is Natsumi compatible with Zen Browser?" As of Natsumi v4, Natsumi has dropped all support for Zen Browser. I have no plans to continue support whatsoever due to the browser's main developer's stance on personalization, as well as various other reasons. Additionally, it'd be a hassle to make things compatible with Zen, mainly because it is just so heavily modified from the original Firefox that I may end up building a whole new skin just for compatibility unintentionally. "When does Natsumi update?" There is no fixed schedule for updates, it all happens randomly. "Is Natsumi compatible with non-Firefox-based browsers Chrome, Arc, etc.?" No. Natsumi is made on top of Firefox, so it only supports Firefox and most of its forks. If you try to apply Natsumi on Chrome/Chromium-based browsers like Arc, you can't apply userchrome CSS files, making Natsumi completely incompatible with those browsers. "I don't like the design, please change it!" If I like the design, nah. My personal skin, my rules. "Can I use your code for my browser?" If your browser is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3 or later or AGPLv3 or later, then yes. Otherwise, please contact me so I can grant you permission. "Why is userChrome.css so empty?" Natsumi Browser uses a system where the userChrome.css file acts as a loader that loads the skin, instead of being the file that contains all rules. This way, it's easier for users to quickly enable and disable custom CSS. "mrrp" meow :3 Troubleshooting "URLbar blur won't work!" Make sure both and are set to true. Also make sure that you're using WebRender and hardware rendering. "I don't see any of the Natsumi options in about:config!" These are custom options which you need to create. Type in the exact name, then press the plus button on the right to create the config. You can also access most of the configs through the browser preferences page if Natsumi Append is installed. "I don't see the Customize Natsumi option in the settings page!" Please check that you've installed fx-autoconfig and is true. "Natsumi looks very weird in Floorp/Waterfox!" This may be because you do not have the Proton design i.e. the default Firefox design enabled. Natsumi only supports Proton and does not support other designs such as Lepton or Fluerial. You can fix this by going to Floorp Hub => Tab & Appearance in Floorp or Look & Feel in Waterfox. "I can't use custom skin X with Natsumi, please add support for it!" This is not something I am able to help with. Natsumi is not tested with other themes in mind, so it is possible that installing incompatible themes alongside Natsumi may break one or more of them. "Something's bugged!" There may be userchromes that you're using alongside Natsumi Browser that breaks things. Please disable these then try again. If the issue still persists, open an issue or report the bug to the developer through Discord.
