I create it to enhance my working experience, and hope that it can be useful to others. V7 is a completely remade version, providing variable font format and source files of font project, redesigning more than half of the glyphs and offering smarter ligatures. You can checkout V6 here Features - ‚ú® Variable - Infinity font weights with fine-grained italic glyphs. - ‚òÅÔ∏è Smooth - Round corner, brand-new glyph of and cursive in italic style. - üí™ Useful - Large amount of smart ligatures, see in ./source/features/README.md - üé® Icon - First-Class Nerd-Font support, make your terminal more vivid. - üî® Customize - Enable or disable font features as you want, just make your own font. Simpified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and Japanese CN version based on Resource Han Rounded provides complete character set support for Chinese development environments, including Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese. Meanwhile, the characteristic of perfect 2:1 alignment between Chinese and English allows this font to achieve a neat, uniform, beautiful, and comfortable appearance in scenarios such as multilingual display and Markdown tables. However, the spacing of Chinese characters is larger compared to other popular Chinese fonts. See details in release notes and this issue. !2-1.png ScreenShots !showcase.png - Pictured by CodeImg - Theme: Maple - Config: font size 16px, line height 1.8, default letter spacing Download You can download all the font archives from Releases.

From my experience, if your screen resolution is lower or equal than 1080P, it is recommended to use "hinted font". Using "unhinted font" will lead to misalignment or uneven thickness on your text. - In this case, you can choose / / , etc. - Unhinted font is used for high resolution screen e.g. for MacBook. Using "hinted font" will blur your text or make it looks weird. - In this case, you can choose / / / , etc. - Why there exists and suffix? - for backward compatibility, I keep the original naming scheme. is only used for format. Custom Build The ./config.json file is used to configure the build process. Checkout the schema or document for more details. There also have some command line options for customizing the build process. Cli options have higher priority than options in . Build In Browser Go to Playground, and click "Custom Build" button in the bottom left corner Use Github Actions You can use Github Actions to build the font. 1. Fork the repo 2. Optional Change the content in 3. Go to Actions tab 4. Click on menu item on the left 5. Click on button with options setup 6. Wait for the build to finish 7. Download the font archives from Releases Use Docker Local Build Clone the repo and run on your local machine. Make sure you have and installed - For or , maybe is needed as well If you have trouble installing the dependencies, just create a new GitHub Codespace and run the commands there Custom Nerd-Font If you want to get fixed width icons, setup in or add flag to build script args. If you want to get variable width icons, setup in or add flag to build script args. For custom args, and maybe as well is required. Maybe you should also change in config.json Default args: - if is , then add - else if is , then add Preset Run with flag, make the font looks not such "Opinioned" , just like with slashed zero. If you are using variable font NOT recommended, please enable to make all features work. Enabled features: <!-- NORMAL --> <!-- NORMAL --> Online Preview Font Feature Freeze There are three kinds of options for feature freeze Why: 1. : Forcely enable the features without setting up / / in font features config, just as default glyphs / ligatures 2. : Remove the features in / / , which will no longer effect, even if you enable it manually 3. : Do nothing Custom OpenType Feature OpenType Feature is used to control the font's built-in variants and ligatures. You can remove some ligatures or features you don't want to, change feature's trigger rule or add some new rules by modifying OpenType Feature. By default, the Python module in ./source/py/feature will generate feature rule string and load it at build time. You can modify the features or customize tags there. If you would like to modify the feature file instead, run with flag, the feature file from ./source/features will be loaded. Infinite Arrow Ligatures Inspired by Fira Code, the font enables infinite arrow ligatures by default from v7.3. For some reason, the ligatures are misaligned when using hinted font, so they are removed in hinted version by default from v7.4. You can setup in or add in cli flag. See more details in 508 Chinese version CN version is disabled by default. Run with flag, the CN base fonts about 111 MB will download from GitHub. If you want to build CN base fonts from variable about 27 MB, setup in config.json and BE PATIENT, instantiation will take about 10-30 minutes. Narrow spacing in CN glyphs If you think that CN glyphs spacing is TOOOOOO large, there is a build option or cli flag to narrow spacing in CN glyphs, but this will make the font cannot be recogized as monospaced font. You can see effect in 249. GitHub Mirror The build script will auto download required assets from GitHub. If you have trouble downloading, please setup in config.json or to your environment variable. Target URL will be , or just download the target file and put it in the same directory as . Traditional Chinese Punctuation Support By enabling , all Chinese punctuation marks will be centred. See more details in 150 Build Script Usage Development Design Using FontLab or Glyphs, generate variable TTF into folder.
