There’s no need to manually pass in or as the environment variables will handle the customization. Hidden port Use NGINX reverse proxy to hide port 6806, please note: Configure WebSocket reverse proxy Note Be sure to confirm the correctness of the mounted volume, otherwise the data will be lost after the container is deleted Do not use URL rewriting for redirection, otherwise there may be problems with authentication, it is recommended to configure a reverse proxy If you encounter permission issues, verify that the and environment variables match the ownership of the mounted directories on your host system Limitations Does not support desktop and mobile application connections, only supports use on browsers Export to PDF, HTML and Word formats is not supported Import Markdown file is not supported </details> Unraid Hosting <details> <summary>Unraid Deployment</summary> Note: First run in the terminal Template reference: </details> Insider Preview We release insider preview before major updates, please visit https://github.com/siyuan-note/insider. 🏘️ Community English Discussion Forum User community summary Awesome SiYuan 🛠️ Development Guide See Development Guide. ❓ FAQ How does SiYuan store data?
