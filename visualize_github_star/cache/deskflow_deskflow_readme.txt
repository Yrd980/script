We're a friendly, active, and welcoming community focused on building a great app. Read our Contributing page to get started. For instructions on building Deskflow, use the wiki page: Building Operating Systems We support all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix-like BSD-derived. > !NOTE > On Windows, you will need to install the > Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. > Download latest: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vcredist.x64.exe https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vcredist.arm64.exe Windows 10 or higher is required. macOS 12 or higher is required. Linux requires libei 1.3+ and libportal 0.8+ for the server/client. Additionally, Qt 6.7+ is required for the GUI. Linux users with systems not meeting these requirements should use flatpak in place of a native package. We officially support FreeBSD, and would also like to support: OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly, Solaris. Repology Repology monitors a huge number of package repositories and other sources comparing package versions across them and gathering other information. !Repologyhttps://repology.org/project/deskflow/versions Note: We are working with package maintainers to have our new package name adopted. Installing on macOS When you install Deskflow on macOS, you need to allow accessibility access Privacy & Security to both the app and the process. If using Sequoia, you may also need to allow under Local Network‍ settings Privacy & Security. When prompted by the OS, go to the settings and enable the access. If you are upgrading and you already have or on the allowed list you will need to manually remove them before accessibility access can be granted to the new version. macOS users who download directly from releases may need to run after copying the app to the dir. It is recommend to install Deskflow using Homebrew from our homebrew-tap To add our tap, run: Then install either: - Stable: - Continuous: Similar Projects In the open source developer community, similar projects collaborate for the improvement of all mouse and keyboard sharing tools. We aim for idea sharing and interoperability. - Lan Mouse - Rust implementation with the goal of having native front-ends and interoperability with Deskflow/Synergy. - Input Leap - Deskflow/Synergy-derivative with the goal of continuing what Barrier started, after Barrier became a dead fork. - Synergy - Downstream commercial fork. Synergy sponsors Deskflow with financial support and contributes code learn more. FAQ Is Deskflow compatible with Synergy, Input Leap, or Barrier? Yes, Deskflow has network compatibility with all forks: - Requires Deskflow >= v1.17.0.96 - Deskflow will just work with Input Leap and Barrier server or client. - Connecting a Deskflow client to a Synergy 1 server will also just work. - To connect a Synergy 1 client, you need to select the Synergy protocol in the Deskflow server settings. Note: Only Synergy 1 is compatible with Deskflow Synergy 3 is not yet compatible. Is Deskflow compatible with Lan Mouse? We would love to see compatibility with Lan Mouse. This may be quite an effort as currently the way they handle the generated input is very different. If I want to solve issues in Deskflow do I need to contribute to a fork? We welcome PRs pull requests from the community. If you'd like to make a change, please feel free to start a discussion or open a PR. Is clipboard sharing supported? Absolutely. The clipboard-sharing feature is a cornerstone feature of the product and we are committed to maintaining and improving that feature. Is Wayland for Linux supported? Yes! Wayland the Linux display server protocol aimed to become the successor of the X Window System is an important platform for us. The https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libei and https://github.com/flatpak/libportal libraries enable Wayland support for Deskflow. We would like to give special thanks to Peter Hutterer, who is the author of , a major contributor to , and the author of the Wayland implementation in Deskflow. Others such as Olivier Fourdan and Povilas Kanapickas helped with the Wayland implementation. Some features may be unavailable or broken on Wayland. Please see the known Wayland issues. Where did it all start? Deskflow was first created as Synergy in 2001 by Chris Schoeneman. Read about the history of the project on our wiki.
