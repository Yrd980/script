Anyone can create, apply, or extend a Goggle. Essentially Goggles act as a custom re-ranking on top of Brave’s search index. This means that, instead of a single ranking, Brave Search can offer an almost limitless number of ranking options. While Brave Search doesn't have editorial biases, all search engines have some level of intrinsic bias due to underlying data the Web and some algorithmic choices of features to select. Goggles allows for users to counter such intrinsic biases in the ranking, and also to create custom search experiences that couldn’t be covered by an all-purpose search engine such as Brave Search. Goggles are owned solely by their creators and, if public, can be used by anyone on top of Brave Search index. Want to start building your own goggles, or fork or extend existing ones?

We treat Goggle URLs with the same strict provisions we use to handle other data elements like IP or geo-coordinates that could serve as identifiers. Brave does not track the queries of any of its users, and searching with Goggles is no exception. However, note that if a Goggle is used only by one, or a very small number of people, the Goggle URL could serve as an identifier, and enable the creation of a profile of the user’s queries while using that particular Goggle.
