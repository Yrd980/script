Requirements - Node.js version v18 or newer - PostgreSQL version v15 or newer - Docker and Docker Compose for containerized setup Getting Started Choose your preferred setup method below. Docker is recommended for quick setup and testing. üöÄ Quick Start Docker - Recommended The fastest way to get Worklenz running locally with all dependencies included. Prerequisites: - Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system - Git Steps: 1. Clone the repository: 2. Start the Docker containers: 3. Access the application: - Frontend: http://localhost:5000 - Backend API: http://localhost:3000 - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 login: minioadmin/minioadmin 4. To stop the services: Alternative startup methods: - Windows: Run - Linux/macOS: Run Video Guide: For a visual walkthrough of the local Docker deployment process, check out our step-by-step video guide. üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation For Development For developers who want to run the services individually or customize the setup. Prerequisites: - Node.js version 18 or higher - PostgreSQL version 15 or higher - An S3-compatible storage service like MinIO or Azure Blob Storage Steps: 1. Clone the repository: 2. Set up environment variables: 3. Install dependencies: 4. Set up the database: 5. Start the development servers: 6. Access the application at http://localhost:5000 Deployment For local development, follow the Quick Start Docker section above. Remote Server Deployment When deploying to a remote server: 1. Set up the environment files with your server's hostname: 2. Pull and run the latest Docker images: 3. Access the application through your server's hostname: - Frontend: http://your-server-hostname:5000 - Backend API: http://your-server-hostname:3000 4. Video Guide: For a complete walkthrough of deploying Worklenz to a remote server, check out our deployment video guide. Configuration Environment Variables Worklenz requires several environment variables to be configured for proper operation. These include: - Database credentials - Session secrets - Storage configuration S3 or Azure - Authentication settings Please refer to the files for a full list of required variables. The Docker setup uses environment variables to configure the services: - Frontend: - : URL of the backend API default: http://backend:3000 for container networking - : WebSocket URL for real-time communication default: ws://backend:3000 - Backend: - Database connection parameters - Storage configuration - Other backend settings For custom configuration, edit the file or the script. MinIO Integration The project uses MinIO as an S3-compatible object storage service, which provides an open-source alternative to AWS S3 for development and production. Working with MinIO MinIO provides an S3-compatible API, so any code that works with S3 will work with MinIO by simply changing the endpoint URL. The backend has been configured to use MinIO by default, with no additional configuration required. - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 - Username: minioadmin - Password: minioadmin - Default Bucket: worklenz-bucket created automatically when the containers start Backend Storage Configuration The backend is pre-configured to use MinIO with the following settings: Security Considerations For production deployments: 1. Use strong, unique passwords and keys for all services 2. Do not commit files to version control 3. Use a production-grade PostgreSQL setup with proper backup procedures 4. Enable HTTPS for all public endpoints 5.
