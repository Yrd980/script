After several scans of the process, scanmem isolates the position of the variable and allows you to modify its value. GUI GameConqueror is a GUI front-end for scanmem, providing more features, such as: Flexible syntax for searching Easier and multiple variable locking Better process finder Memory browser/editor See gui/README.md for more details. Requirements scanmem requires libreadline to read commands interactively, and must be mounted. GameConqueror requirements are documented in gui/README.md. Documentation To read documentation: enter at the scanmem prompt use the interactive help of GameConqueror Build Requirements The build requires autotools-dev, libtool, libreadline-dev, intltool, and python. Build and Install To generate files required for the build: ./autogen.sh To build with GUI: ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-gui && make sudo make install To build without GUI: ./configure --prefix=/usr && make sudo make install scanmem and GameConqueror use static paths to libscanmem. So executing is not required. Consider setting or to avoid that libscanmem is in a library search path. Run for more details. Android Build You need a standalone toolchain of Android NDK Advanced method to build interactive capabilities for Android.
