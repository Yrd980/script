Contributing Contributing to Envoy is fun and modern C++ is a lot less scary than you might think if you don't have prior experience. To get started: Contributing guide Beginner issues Build/test quick start using docker Developer guide Consider installing the Envoy development support toolchain, which helps automate parts of the development process, particularly those involving code review. Please make sure that you let us know if you are working on an issue so we don't duplicate work! Community Meeting The Envoy team has a scheduled meeting time twice per month on Tuesday at 9am PT. The public Google calendar is here. The meeting will only be held if there are agenda items listed in the meeting minutes. Any member of the community should be able to propose agenda items by adding to the minutes. The maintainers will either confirm the additions to the agenda, or will cancel the meeting within 24 hours of the scheduled date if there is no confirmed agenda. Security Security Audit There has been several third party engagements focused on Envoy security: In 2018 Cure53 performed a security audit, full report. In 2021 Ada Logics performed an audit on our fuzzing infrastructure with recommendations for improvements, full report. Reporting security vulnerabilities If you've found a vulnerability or a potential vulnerability in Envoy please let us know at envoy-security. We'll send a confirmation email to acknowledge your report, and we'll send an additional email when we've identified the issue positively or negatively. For further details please see our complete security release process. ppc64le builds Builds for the ppc64le architecture or using aws-lc are not covered by the envoy security policy. The ppc64le architecture is currently best-effort and not maintained by the Envoy maintainers. Releases For further details please see our release process.
