Apidox https://api.kde.org/okular/html/index.html Contributing Okular uses the merge request workflow. Merge requests are required to run pre-commit CI jobs; please don’t push to the master branch directly. See https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/GitLab for an introduction. Build instructions Okular can be built like many other applications developed by KDE. See https://community.kde.org/GetInvolved/development for an introduction. If your build environment is set up correctly, you can also build Okular using CMake: Okular also builds tests in the build tree. To run them, you have to run first. If you install Okular in a different path than your system install directory it is possible that you need to run so that the correct Okular instance and libraries are picked up. Afterwards one can run inside the shell instance. The source command is also required to run the tests manually. As stated above, Okular has various build targets. Two of them are executables. You can choose which executable to build by passing a flag to CMake: Available options are , , and . clang-format The Okular project uses clang-format to enforce source code formatting. See README.clangformat for more information.
