Styles have the following shape: To edit the different highlight groups, include them in your file. For example, to edit the highlight group, add the following to your : Expand the section below to see the default config for the highlight groups: <details> <summary>Default highlight groups settings</summary> </details> Disabling Highlight Groups To individually disable or enable highlight groups, use the and flags: Adding Keywords via theme.toml To add custom keywords, either include them in the list of keywords or add new entries: Adding Keywords from the command line Sometimes it is more convenient to add highlight groups on the fly without having to edit a TOML. To add highlights from the command line, use the flag followed by a comma separated list of words to be highlighted. For example: <p align="center"> <img src="assets/examples/otf.png" width="800"/> </p> Custom regex highlighters When you need more control over the highlighting, you can use the regex highlighter. This highlighter allows you to specify a regex and a style to be applied to the matched text. It supports one capture group . When found, it will apply the style to the captured text. Working with and Default behavior with pipes By default, will open a file in the pager . However, if you pipe something into , it will print the highlighted output directly to . This is similar to running . To let highlight the logs of different commands, you can pipe the output of those commands into like so: Capturing the output of a command and viewing it in To capture the output of a command and view it in , use the flag: This will run the command in the background and pipe the output to . The output will be displayed in , allowing you to navigate and search through the logs. Using the pager Overview uses as its pager to view the highlighted log files. You can get more info on via the man command or by hitting the <kbd>h</kbd> button to access the help screen. Navigating Navigating within uses a set of keybindings that may be familiar to users of or other -like editors. Here's a brief overview of the most useful navigation commands: - <kbd>j</kbd>/<kbd>k</kbd>: Scroll one line up / down - <kbd>d</kbd>/<kbd>u</kbd>: Scroll one half-page up / down - <kbd>g</kbd>/<kbd>G</kbd>: Go to the top / bottom of the file Follow mode When you run with the or flag, it will scroll to the bottom and print new lines to the screen as they're added to the file. To stop following the file, interrupt with <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>. This will stop the tailing, but keep the file open, allowing you to review the existing content. To resume following the file from within , press <kbd>Shift + F</kbd>. Search Use <kbd>/</kbd> followed by your search query. For example, finds the first occurrence of ERROR. After the search, <kbd>n</kbd> finds the next instance, and <kbd>N</kbd> finds the previous instance. Filtering allows filtering lines by a keyword, using <kbd>&</kbd> followed by the pattern. For instance, shows only lines with ERROR. To only show lines containing either or , use a regular expression: . To clear the filter, use <kbd>&</kbd> with no pattern. Custom pagers Set the environment variable to override the default pager. The command must include the string FILE which will be replaced with the file path internally. For example: Settings
