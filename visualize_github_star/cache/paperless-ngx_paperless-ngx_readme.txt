Important Note > Document scanners are typically used to scan sensitive documents like your social insurance number, tax records, invoices, etc. Paperless-ngx should never be run on an untrusted host because information is stored in clear text without encryption. No guarantees are made regarding security but we do try! and you use the app at your own risk. > The safest way to run Paperless-ngx is on a local server in your own home with backups in place.
