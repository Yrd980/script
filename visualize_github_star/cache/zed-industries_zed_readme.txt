We use https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following: - Is it showing a error for a crate you've created? If so, add under in your crate's Cargo.toml. - Is the error for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license's requirements. If you're unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you've verified that this system is acceptable add the license's SPDX identifier to the array in . - Is unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of , as specified in the cargo-about book.
