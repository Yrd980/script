Override reveal theme with a custom one. In this example, the file is at : Override reveal theme with a remote one use rawgit.com because the url must allow cross-site access: Highlight Theme Override highlight theme default: : See available themes35. Custom Slide Separators Override slide separator default: : Override vertical/nested slide separator default: : Custom Slide Attributes Use the reveal.js slide attributes36 functionality to add HTML attributes, e.g. custom backgrounds. Alternatively, add an HTML attribute to a specific slide and style it with CSS. Example: set the second slide to have a PNG image as background: reveal-md Options Define options similar to command-line options in a file that must be located at the root of the Markdown files. They'll be picked up automatically. Example: Reveal.js Options Define Reveal.js options37 in a file at the project root. They'll be picked up automatically. Example: Speaker Notes Use the speaker notes38 feature by using a line starting with . YAML Front matter Set Markdown and reveal.js options specific to a presentation with YAML front matter: Live Reload Using option changes to markdown files will trigger the browser to reload and thus display the changed presentation without the user having to reload the browser. Custom Scripts Inject custom scripts into the page: - Don't use absolute file paths, files should be in adjacent or descending folders. - Absolute URL's are allowed. Custom CSS Inject custom CSS into the page: - Don't use absolute file paths, files should be in adjacent or descending folders. - Absolute URL's are allowed. Custom Favicon If the directory with the markdown files contains a file, it will automatically be used as a favicon instead of the default favicon39. Pre-process Markdown can be given a markdown preprocessor script via the or option. This can be useful to implement custom tweaks on the document format without having to dive into the guts of the Markdown parser. For example, to have headers automatically create new slides, one could have the script : and use it like this Print to PDF There are at least two options to export a deck to a PDF file. 1. Using Puppeteer Create a printable PDF from the provided Markdown file: The PDF is generated using Puppeteer. Alternatively, append to the url from the command-line or in the browser make sure to remove the or hash. Then print the slides using the browser's not the native print dialog. This seems to work in Chrome. By default, paper size is set to match options in your 14 file, falling back to a default value 960x700 pixels. To override this behaviour, you can pass custom dimensions or format in a command line option : In case of an error, please try the following: - Analyze debug output, e.g. - See for Puppeteer arguments and - Use Docker & DeckTape: 2. Using Docker & DeckTape The first method of printing does not currently work when running reveal-md in a Docker container, so it is recommended that you print with DeckTape40 instead. Using DeckTape may also resolve issues with the built-in printing method’s output. To create a PDF of a presentation using reveal-md running on your localhost using the DeckTape Docker image, use the following command: Replace these variables: - is the folder you want the PDF to be saved to. - is the name of the PDF. - is where the presentation can be accessed in your browser without the suffix. If you are not running reveal-md in Docker, you will need to replace with the IP address of your computer. For a full list of export options, please see the the DeckTape github40, or run the Docker container with the flag.

The files are saved to the directory passed to the parameter default: : This should copy images along with the slides. Use to copy directories with other static assets to the target directory. Use a comma-separated list to copy multiple directories. Providing a directory will result in a stand-alone overview page with links to the presentations similar to a directory listing27: By default, all files in all subdirectories are included in the generated website. Provide a custom glob pattern41 using to generate slides only from matching files: Additional and parameters could be used to generate OpenGraph42 metadata enabling more attractive rendering for slide deck links when shared in some social sites.
