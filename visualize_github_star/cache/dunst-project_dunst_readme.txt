Have espeak read out your notifications, or play a song when your significant other signs on in pidgin! üìã Rules Change the look or behavior of notifications matching a specified pattern. You could use this to change the color of message notifications from your favorite jabber buddies, or to prevent important work email notifications from disappearing until you manually dismiss them. ‚è∏Ô∏è Pause If you want to take a break and not receive any notifications for a while, just pause dunst. All notifications will be saved for you to catch up later. Additionally, you can set a numeric pause level, which allows you to pause dunst selectively for some notifications, where more urgent notifications get through, but less urgent stay paused. üïò History Catch an unread notification disappearing from the corner of your eye? Just tap a keyboard shortcut to replay the last notification, or continue tapping to see your notification history. Documentation Most documentation can be found in dunst's man pages. In dunst1 contains some general instructions on how to run dunst and in dunst5 all of dunst's configuration options are explained. On the dunst wikiwiki you can find guides and installation instructions and on the dunst websitewebsite there is a FAQFAQ with common issues. Installation Dunst is available in many package repositories. If it's not available in your distro's repositories, don't worry, it's not hard to build it yourself. Dependencies - dbus runtime - libxinerama - libxrandr - libxss - glib - pango/cairo - gdk-pixbuf - libnotify can build without, for dunstify, see make parameters - wayland-client can build without, see make parameters - wayland-protocols optional, for recompiling protocols - xdg-utils optional, xdg-open is the default 'browser' for opening URLs - jq optional, for installed completions and tools in contrib - busctl optional, for dunstctl rules and dunstctl history The names will be different depending on your distribution. Building Makefile Meson Custom Meson build parameters can be found in mesonoptions.txt. Make parameters - : Set the destination directory of the installation. Default: - : Set the prefix of the installation. Default: - : Set the executable's path Default: - : Set the path for shared files. Default: - : Set the path for installation of bash completion files. Default: - : Set the path for installation of fish completion files. Default: - : Set the path for installation of zsh completion files. Default: - : Set the base directory for system config files. Default: - : Set the absolute path to which the default dunstrc shall be installed. Default: - : Overwrite existing . Default: 0 don't overwrite - : Set the prefix of the manpage. Default: - : Disable/Enable the systemd unit. Default: autodetect systemd - : Disable/Enable wayland support. Default: 1 enabled - : Disable/Enable X11 support. Default: 1 enabled - : Disable/Enable the libnotify dunstctl utility. Default: 1 enabled - : Disable/Enable installation of shell completions. Default: 1 enabled - : The path to put the systemd user service file. Unused, if . Default: - : The path to put the dbus service file. Default: - : Additional flags for the compiler. Make sure to run all make calls with the same parameter set. So when building with , you have to install it with , too. Either X11 or WAYLAND should be set, otherwise dunst will not compile. Notes on default of XDGCONFIGDIRS Dunst uses a different default for XDGCONFIGDIRS at runtime. This is a slight digression from the recommended value in the XDG Base Directory Specification /etc/xdg, because the default config file gets installed to to avoid conflicts with /etc/xdg/dunst/dunstrc which might have been installed from a distribution repository. If you do want dunst to use the spec's recommended default, set XDGCONFIGDIR=/etc/xdg at runtime or SYSCONFDIR=/etc/xdg at compile time. Notes on SYSCONFFILE Changing SYSCONFFILE does not affect the search for config files, meaning it will not take effect if you choose to install dunstrc to a location that cannot be found by the algorithm outlined in the FILES section of dunst1. will not overwrite an already existing $SYSCONFFILE i.e. /usr/local/etc/xdg/dunst/dunstrc, see SYSCONFFORCENEW above. This is so you do not lose local changes to said file on upgrade. However, it is recommended to leave that file untouched and use a more important config location to override settings, see the FILES section in dunst1 for more details. will not remove $SYSCONFFILE, use if you do want it removed as well. Contributing Contributions are very welcome. Before contributing, make sure to look at the contribution documentation in HACKING.md. Make sure you test your code and where possible add automated tests. These tests are also checked on memory leaks with . Troubleshooting Cannot set settings via command line This functionality was removed during the refactor. It might be re-added later in some form. See 940 for details.
