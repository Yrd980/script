The project is very active – currently > 3100 commits. zinit-4 !GitHub last commit !GitHub Repo stars This is Zinit 4 from the original author, who once removed the Zinit repository from GitHub. This spawned a community-driven zdharma-continuum organization that revived all of psprint's ZSH projects. Its main innovations from the @zdharma-continuum fork are: - AppImage distribution release link, - Action complete – press Alt-Shift-A and Alt-Shift-C to complete plugin names and ice modifiers, - Themes – set $ZITHEME to one of default, blue and gold to set a color set to use for Zinit 4 messages, - New ice which is equivalent of three other ices: , and and simply builds the project from sources, with support for autotools/CMake/Meson/Scons. These are the most visible changes, but there are more like e.g.: support for compiling with libraries from previously built projects/. zit !GitHub last commit !GitHub Repo stars zit is a plugin manager for ZSH.
