linux-ck-autobuild About > Linux-ck is a package that allows users to run a kernel and headers setup patched with Con Kolivas' ck patchset, including a CPU scheduler named MuQSS Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler, pronounced mux which replaces Brain Fuck Scheduler BFS, his previous work. Many Arch Linux users choose this kernel for its excellent desktop interactivity and responsiveness under any load situation. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/linux-ck Being a longtime user and advocate of linux-ck myself, i felt a bit handicapped when a few older architectures were dropped from Graysky's unofficial repository: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1934484p1934484 This means that users now have to build the kernels themselves for each of the dropped architectures. Now i have to say that the linux-ck package from the AUR Arch User Repository works very well and is easy to configure, however it takes at least an hour to build one architecture and cannot be automated. This means you'll have to check for updates, check the build and then build another. All in all that would just be a very painful experience, so i decided to make a fully automated version of linux-ck. Features Automatically builds desired architectures Daemon which monitors for new releases and automatically starts the build script Option to limit system resources Compatible with modprobe-db Custom commands that can be run after the build script Automatically checks the ck repo for pre-built kernels Option to add build kernels to your local repo Installing This package can be installed from the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-ck-autobuild from a command line simply run: from a command line.
