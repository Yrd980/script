!Application Icon for Edit Edit A simple editor for simple needs. This editor pays homage to the classic MS-DOS Editor, but with a modern interface and input controls similar to VS Code. The goal is to provide an accessible editor that even users largely unfamiliar with terminals can easily use. !Screenshot of Edit with the About dialog in the foreground Installation !Packaging statushttps://repology.org/project/microsoft-edit/versions You can also download binaries from our Releases page.

The following table lists the available configuration options: Environment variable | Description --- | --- | See ICU library name SONAME for details. | A comma-separated list of languages to include in the build. See i18n/edit.toml for available languages. Notes to Package Maintainers Package Naming The canonical executable name is "edit" and the alternative name is "msedit". We're aware of the potential conflict of "edit" with existing commands and recommend alternatively naming packages and executables "msedit". Names such as "ms-edit" should be avoided. Assigning an "edit" alias is recommended, if possible. ICU library name SONAME This project optionally depends on the ICU library for its Search and Replace functionality. By default, the project will look for a SONAME without version suffix: Windows: macOS: UNIX, and other OS: If your installation uses a different SONAME, please set the following environment variable at build time: : For instance, . : For instance, . Additionally, this project assumes that the ICU exports are exported without prefix and without version suffix, such as . If your installation uses versioned exports, please set: : If set to , it'll look for C++ symbols such as . Enabled by default on macOS. : If set to a version number, such as , it'll look for symbols such as . Finally, you can set the following environment variables: : If set to , the executable will try to detect the value at runtime. The way it does this is not officially supported by ICU and as such is not recommended to be relied upon. Enabled by default on UNIX excluding macOS if no other options are set. To test your settings, run again but with the flag. For instance:
