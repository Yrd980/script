But you can do the following: - Create a new GitHub repo, for example . - Clone this repository manually, set the name with the name of the project you want to use, for example : - Enter into the new directory: - Set the new origin to your new repository, copy it from the GitHub interface, for example: - Add this repo as another "remote" to allow you to get updates later: - Push the code to your new repository: Update From the Original Template After cloning the repository, and after doing changes, you might want to get the latest changes from this original template. - Make sure you added the original repository as a remote, you can check it with: - Pull the latest changes without merging: This will download the latest changes from this template without committing them, that way you can check everything is right before committing. - If there are conflicts, solve them in your editor. - Once you are done, commit the changes: Configure You can then update configs in the files to customize your configurations. Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for: - - - You can and should pass these as environment variables from secrets. Read the deployment.md docs for more details. Generate Secret Keys Some environment variables in the file have a default value of . You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command: Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key. How To Use It - Alternative With Copier This repository also supports generating a new project using Copier. It will copy all the files, ask you configuration questions, and update the files with your answers. Install Copier You can install Copier with: Or better, if you have https://pipx.pypa.io/, you can run it with: Note: If you have , installing copier is optional, you could run it directly. Generate a Project With Copier Decide a name for your new project's directory, you will use it below. For example, . Go to the directory that will be the parent of your project, and run the command with your project's name: If you have and you didn't install , you can run it directly: Note the option is necessary to be able to execute a post-creation script that updates your files. Input Variables Copier will ask you for some data, you might want to have at hand before generating the project. But don't worry, you can just update any of that in the files afterwards. The input variables, with their default values some auto generated are: - : default: The name of the project, shown to API users in .env. - : default: The name of the stack used for Docker Compose labels and project name no spaces, no periods in .env. - : default: The secret key for the project, used for security, stored in .env, you can generate one with the method above. - : default: The email of the first superuser in .env. - : default: The password of the first superuser in .env. - : default: "" The SMTP server host to send emails, you can set it later in .env. - : default: "" The SMTP server user to send emails, you can set it later in .env. - : default: "" The SMTP server password to send emails, you can set it later in .env. - : default: The email account to send emails from, you can set it later in .env. - : default: The password for the PostgreSQL database, stored in .env, you can generate one with the method above. - : default: "" The DSN for Sentry, if you are using it, you can set it later in .env.
