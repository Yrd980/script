CSS only Bulma is a CSS framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file: bulma.css You can either use that file, "out of the box", or download the Sass source files to customize the variables. There is no JavaScript included. People generally want to use their own JS implementation and usually already have one. Bulma can be considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of the logic. Browser Support Bulma uses autoprefixer to make most Flexbox features compatible with earlier browser versions. According to Can I use, Bulma is compatible with recent versions of: - Chrome - Edge - Firefox - Opera - Safari Internet Explorer 10+ is only partially supported.
