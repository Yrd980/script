For more information, see the Wayland support section Rofi started as a clone of simpleswitcher, written by Sean Pringle - a popup window switcher roughly based on superswitcher. Simpleswitcher laid the foundations, and therefore Sean Pringle deserves most of the credit for this tool. Rofi renamed, as it lost the simple property has been extended with extra features, like an application launcher and ssh-launcher, and can act as a drop-in dmenu replacement, making it a very versatile tool. Rofi, like dmenu, will provide the user with a textual list of options where one or more can be selected. This can either be running an application, selecting a window, or options provided by an external script. What is rofi not? Rofi is not: - A UI toolkit. - A library to be used in other applications. - An application that can support every possible use-case. It tries to be generic enough to be usable by everybody. - Specific functionality can be added using scripts or plugins, many exists. - Just a dmenu replacement. The dmenu functionality is a nice 'extra' to rofi, not its main purpose.
