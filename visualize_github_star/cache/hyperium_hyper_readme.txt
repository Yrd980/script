"Low-level" hyper is a relatively low-level library, meant to be a building block for libraries and applications. If you are looking for a convenient HTTP client, then you may wish to consider reqwest. If you are not sure what HTTP server to choose, then you may want to consider axum or warp, the latter taking a more functional approach. Both are built on top of this library.
