Ninja Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. https://ninja-build.org/ See the manual or included in the distribution for background and more details. Binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows are available on GitHub. Run for Ninja help. Installation is not necessary because the only required file is the resulting ninja binary. However, to enable features like Bash completion and Emacs and Vim editing modes, some files in misc/ must be copied to appropriate locations. If you're interested in making changes to Ninja, read CONTRIBUTING.md first. Building Ninja itself You can either build Ninja via the custom generator script written in Python or via CMake. For more details see the wiki. Python This will generate the binary and a file you can now use to build Ninja with itself. If you have a GoogleTest source directory, you can build the tests by passing its path with option, or the environment variable, e.g.: Use the CMake build below if you want to use a preinstalled binary version of the library. CMake To build the ninja binary without building the unit tests, disable test building by setting to : The binary will now be inside the directory you can choose any other name you like. To run the unit tests, omit the option, and after building, run: Generating documentation Ninja Manual You must have and in your PATH, then do: Which will generate . To generate the PDF version of the manual, you must have in your PATH then do: Which will generate . Doxygen documentation If you have installed, you can build documentation extracted from C++ declarations and comments to help you navigate the code. Note that Ninja is a standalone executable, not a library, so there is no public API, all details exposed here are internal. Then open in a browser to look at it.
