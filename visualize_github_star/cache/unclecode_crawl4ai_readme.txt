Release notes → <details> <summary>🤓 <strong>My Personal Story</strong></summary> I grew up on an Amstrad, thanks to my dad, and never stopped building. In grad school I specialized in NLP and built crawlers for research. That’s where I learned how much extraction matters. In 2023, I needed web-to-Markdown. The “open source” option wanted an account, API token, and $16, and still under-delivered. I went turbo anger mode, built Crawl4AI in days, and it went viral. Now it’s the most-starred crawler on GitHub. I made it open source for availability, anyone can use it without a gate. Now I’m building the platform for affordability, anyone can run serious crawls without breaking the bank. If that resonates, join in, send feedback, or just crawl something amazing. </details> <details> <summary>Why developers pick Crawl4AI</summary> - LLM ready output, smart Markdown with headings, tables, code, citation hints - Fast in practice, async browser pool, caching, minimal hops - Full control, sessions, proxies, cookies, user scripts, hooks - Adaptive intelligence, learns site patterns, explores only what matters - Deploy anywhere, zero keys, CLI and Docker, cloud friendly </details> 🚀 Quick Start 1.
