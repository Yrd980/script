Latest updates -- SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos Please check out our new release on Segment Anything Model 2 SAM 2. SAM 2 code: https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2 SAM 2 demo: https://sam2.metademolab.com/ SAM 2 paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00714 !SAM 2 architecture Segment Anything Model 2 SAM 2 is a foundation model towards solving promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. We extend SAM to video by considering images as a video with a single frame. The model design is a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. We build a model-in-the-loop data engine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect our SA-V dataset, the largest video segmentation dataset to date. SAM 2 trained on our data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks and visual domains.

It has been trained on a dataset of 11 million images and 1.1 billion masks, and has strong zero-shot performance on a variety of segmentation tasks. <p float="left"> <img src="assets/masks1.png?raw=true" width="37.25%" /> <img src="assets/masks2.jpg?raw=true" width="61.5%" /> </p> Installation The code requires , as well as and . Please follow the instructions here to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended. Install Segment Anything: or clone the repository locally and install with The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. is also required to run the example notebooks. <a name="GettingStarted"></a>Getting Started First download a model checkpoint. Then the model can be used in just a few lines to get masks from a given prompt: or generate masks for an entire image: Additionally, masks can be generated for images from the command line: See the examples notebooks on using SAM with prompts and automatically generating masks for more details. <p float="left"> <img src="assets/notebook1.png?raw=true" width="49.1%" /> <img src="assets/notebook2.png?raw=true" width="48.9%" /> </p> ONNX Export SAM's lightweight mask decoder can be exported to ONNX format so that it can be run in any environment that supports ONNX runtime, such as in-browser as showcased in the demo. Export the model with See the example notebook for details on how to combine image preprocessing via SAM's backbone with mask prediction using the ONNX model. It is recommended to use the latest stable version of PyTorch for ONNX export. Web demo The folder has a simple one page React app which shows how to run mask prediction with the exported ONNX model in a web browser with multithreading. Please see https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/demo/README.md for more details. <a name="Models"></a>Model Checkpoints Three model versions of the model are available with different backbone sizes. These models can be instantiated by running Click the links below to download the checkpoint for the corresponding model type. - or : ViT-H SAM model. - : ViT-L SAM model. - : ViT-B SAM model. Dataset See here for an overview of the datastet. The dataset can be downloaded here. By downloading the datasets you agree that you have read and accepted the terms of the SA-1B Dataset Research License. We save masks per image as a json file. It can be loaded as a dictionary in python in the below format. Image ids can be found in saimagesids.txt which can be downloaded using the above link as well. To decode a mask in COCO RLE format into binary: See here for more instructions to manipulate masks stored in RLE format. License The model is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
