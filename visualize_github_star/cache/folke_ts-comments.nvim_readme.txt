🚀 Tiny plugin to enhance Neovim's native comments: - Easily override the comment string for a given treesitter language - Supports different comment strings for different treesitter node types - Relaxed rules for uncommenting - Add proper whitespace when needed - Supports multiple commentstrings for the same language. The first one is used for adding comments. All are used for uncommenting. ⚡️ Requirements - Neovim >= 0.10.0 📦 Installation Using lazy.nvim: ⚙️ Configuration ts-comments.nvim uses the default Neovim as a fallback, so there's no need to configure every language. Default configuration: <!-- config:start --> <!-- config:end --> 🔗 Related - nvim-ts-context-commentstring
