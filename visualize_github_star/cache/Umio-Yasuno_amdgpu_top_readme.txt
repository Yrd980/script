AMDGPU\TOP is tool that display AMD GPU utilization, like umr or clbr/radeontop or intelgputop. The tool displays information gathered from performance counters GRBM, GRBM2, sensors, fdinfo, and AMDGPU driver. | Simple TUI<br>like nvidia-smi, rocm-smi | TUI | GUI | | :-: | :-: | :-: | | !amdgputop Simple TUI | !amdgputop TUI | !amdgputop GUI mode | Quick links Usage Options Commands for TUI Example of using JSON mode fdinfo description Installation Packages Build from source Distribution specific instructions Binary Size References Translations Alternatives Dependent dynamic libraries libdrm libdrmamdgpu Usage Options Commands for TUI | key | | | :-- | :---------------------------------: | | g | toggle GRBM | | r | toggle GRBM2 | | v | toggle VRAM/GTT Usage | | f | toggle fdinfo | | n | toggle Sensors | | m | toggle GPU Metrics | | h | change update interval high = 100ms, low = 1000ms | | q | Quit | | P | sort fdinfo by pid | | M | sort fdinfo by VRAM usage | | G | sort fdinfo by GFX usage | | M | sort fdinfo by MediaEngine usage | | R | reverse sort | Example of using JSON mode Output fdinfo description fdinfo for the AMDGPU driver shows hardware IP usage per process. VRAM GPU Memory. GTT Graphics Translation Tables. KFD The process of using the AMDKFD driver. GFX GFX engine. Compute/COMP Compute engine. The AMDKFD driver dose not track queues and does not show them in fdinfo. DMA DMA/SDMA System DMA engine. Decode/DEC Media decoder. This is not show on VCN4 or later. Encode/ENC Media encoder. This is not show on VCN4 or later. VCN, Media Media engine. From VCN4, the encoding queue and decoding queue have been unified. The AMDGPU driver handles both decoding and encoding as contexts for the encoding engine. This is the average of the video decoder/encoder and the JPEG decoder usage. JPEG JPEG decoder. VPE Video Processor Engine. ref: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/main/src/amd/vpelib/README.md?reftype=heads> VCNUnified, VCNU The video decoder/encoder usage for VCN4.
