Self-hostable alternative to Retool, Pipedream, Superblocks and a simplified Temporal with autogenerated UIs and custom UIs to trigger workflows and scripts as internal apps. <p align=center> Scripts are turned into sharable UIs automatically, and can be composed together into flows or used into richer apps built with low-code. Supported script languages supported are: Python, TypeScript, Go, Bash, SQL, and GraphQL. </p> <p align="center"> <a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/LICENSE-AGPL" target="blank"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPLv3-blue.svg" alt="Package version"> </a> <a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml" target="blank"> <img src="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg" alt="Docker Image CI"> </a> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/wmill" target="blank"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wmill?color=%2334D058&label=pypi%20package" alt="Package version"> </a> </p> <p align="center"> <a href="https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/windmill-labs/windmill" target="blank"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/windmill-labs/windmill" alt="Commit activity"> </a> <a href="https://discord.gg/V7PM2YHsPB" target="blank"> <img src="https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/930051556043276338/widget.png" alt="Discord Shield"/> </a> </p> <p align="center"> <a href="https://app.windmill.dev">Try it</a> - <a href="https://www.windmill.dev/docs/intro/">Docs</a> - <a href="https://discord.gg/V7PM2YHsPB">Discord</a> - <a href="https://hub.windmill.dev">Hub</a> - <a href="https://www.windmill.dev/docs/misc/contributing">Contributor's guide</a> </p> Windmill - Developer platform for APIs, background jobs, workflows and UIs Windmill is <b>fully open-sourced AGPLv3</b> and Windmill Labs offers dedicated instance and commercial support and licenses. !Windmill Diagram https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/assets/122811744/0b132cd1-ee67-4505-822f-0c7ee7104252 - Windmill - Developer platform for APIs, background jobs, workflows and UIs - Main Concepts - Show me some actual script code - CLI - Running scripts locally - Stack - Fastest Self-Hostable Workflow Engine - Security - Sandboxing - Secrets, credentials and sensitive values - Performance - Architecture - How to self-host - Docker compose - Kubernetes k8s and Helm charts - Run from binaries - OAuth, SSO \& SMTP - Commercial license - Integrations - Environment Variables - Run a local dev setup - only Frontend - Backend + Frontend - Contributors - Copyright Main Concepts 1. Define a minimal and generic script in Python, TypeScript, Go or Bash that solves a specific task. The code can be defined in the provided Web IDE or synchronized with your own GitHub repo e.g. through VS Code extension: !Step 1 2. Your scripts parameters are automatically parsed and generate a frontend. !Step 2 !Step 3 3. Make it flow! You can chain your scripts or scripts made by the community shared on WindmillHub. !Step 3 4. Build complex UIs on top of your scripts and flows. !Step 4 Scripts and flows can also be triggered by a cron schedule e.g. '/5 \ \ \' or through webhooks. You can build your entire infra on top of Windmill! Show me some actual script code CLI We have a powerful CLI to interact with the windmill platform and sync your scripts from local files, GitHub repos and to run scripts and flows on the instance from local commands. See more details. !CLI Screencast Running scripts locally You can run your script locally easily, you simply need to pass the right environment variables for the client library to fetch resources and variables from your instance if necessary. See more: <https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/localdevelopment>. To develop & test locally scripts & flows, we recommend using the Windmill VS Code extension: <https://www.windmill.dev/docs/clilocaldev/vscode-extension>. Stack - Postgres as the database. - Backend in Rust with the following highly-available and horizontally scalable. Architecture: - Stateless API backend. - Workers that pull jobs from a queue in Postgres and later, Kafka or Redis. Upvote 173 if interested. - Frontend in Svelte. - Scripts executions are sandboxed using Google's nsjail. - Javascript runtime is the denocore rust library which itself uses the rustyv8 and hence V8 underneath. - TypeScript runtime is Bun and deno. - Python runtime is python3. - Golang runtime is 1.19.1. Fastest Self-Hostable Workflow Engine We have compared Windmill to other self-hostable workflow engines Airflow, Prefect & Temporal and Windmill is the most performant solution for both benchmarks: one flow composed of 40 lightweight tasks & one flow composed of 10 long-running tasks. All methodology & results on our Benchmarks page. !Fastest workflow engine Security Sandboxing Windmill can use nsjail. It is production multi-tenant grade secure. Do not take our word for it, take fly.io's one. Secrets, credentials and sensitive values There is one encryption key per workspace to encrypt the credentials and secrets stored in Windmill's K/V store. In addition, we strongly recommend that you encrypt the whole Postgres database. That is what we do at <https://app.windmill.dev>. Performance Once a job started, there is no overhead compared to running the same script on the node with its corresponding runner Deno/Go/Python/Bash. The added latency from a job being pulled from the queue, started, and then having its result sent back to the database is ~50ms. A typical lightweight deno job will take around 100ms total. Architecture <p align="center"> <img src="./imgs/diagram.svg"> </p> How to self-host We only provide docker-compose setup here. For more advanced setups, like compiling from source or using without a postgres super user, see Self-Host documentation. Docker compose Windmill can be deployed using 3 files: docker-compose.yml, Caddyfile and a .env in a single command. Make sure Docker is started, and run: Go to http://localhost et voilà : The default super-admin user is: admin@windmill.dev / changeme. From there, you can follow the setup app and create other users. More details in Self-Host Documention. Kubernetes k8s and Helm charts We publish helm charts at: <https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts>. Run from binaries Each release includes the corresponding binaries for x8664. You can simply download the latest binary using the following set of bash commands. OAuth, SSO & SMTP Windmill Community Edition allows to configure the OAuth, SSO including Google Workspace SSO, Microsoft/Azure and Okta directly from the UI in the superadmin settings. Do note that there is a limit of 10 SSO users on the community edition. See documentation. Commercial license See the LICENSE file for the full license text. The "Community Edition" of Windmill available in the docker images hosted under ghcr.io/windmill-labs/windmill and the github binary releases contains the files under the AGPLv3 and Apache 2 sources but also includes proprietary and non-public code and features which are not open source and under the following terms: Windmill Labs, Inc. grants a right to use all the features of the "Community Edition" for free without restrictions other than the limits and quotas set in the software and a right to distribute the community edition as is but not to sell, resell, serve Windmill as a managed service, modify or wrap under any form without an explicit agreement. The binary compilable from source code in this repository without the "enterprise" feature flag is open-source under the LICENSE-AGPLv3 License terms and conditions. To re-expose directly any Windmill parts to your users as a feature of your product, with the exception of iframed public Windmill "apps", or to build a feature on top of "Windmill Community Edition" that you sell commercially or embed in a distributable product or binary, you must get a commercial license. Contact us at <sales@windmill.dev> if you have any questions. To do the same from the binary compiled from the source code in this repository without the "enterprise" feature flag, you must comply with the AGPLv3 license terms and conditions or get a commercial license from Windmill Labs, Inc. To use Windmill "Community Edition" as is internally in your organization, or to use its APIs as is, you do NOT need a commercial license. Integrations In Windmill, integrations are referred to as resources and resource types. Each Resource has a Resource Type that defines the schema that the resource needs to implement. On self-hosted instances, you might want to import all the approved resource types from WindmillHub. A setup script will prompt you to have it being synced automatically everyday.

See the ./frontend/READMEDEV.md file for all running options. only Frontend This will use the backend of <https://app.windmill.dev> but your own frontend with hot-code reloading. Note that you will need to use a username / password login due to CSRF checks using a different auth provider. In the directory: 1. install the dependencies with or or 2. generate the windmill client: 3. Run your dev server with 4. Et voilà, windmill should be available at Backend + Frontend See the ./frontend/READMEDEV.md file for all running options. 1. Create a Postgres Database for Windmill and create an admin role inside your Postgres setup. The easiest way to get a working db is to run This will also avoid compile time issue with sqlx's macro 2. Install nsjail and have it accessible in your PATH 3. Install deno and python3, have the bins at and 4. Install caddy 5. Install the lld linker 6. Go to : 1. , then 2. You might need to set some extra heap space for the node runtime 3. In another shell otherwise the backend will not find the folder and will not compile. 4. In another shell 7. Go to : 8. Et voilà, windmill should be available at Contributors <a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/graphs/contributors"> <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=windmill-labs/windmill" /> </a> Copyright Windmill Labs, Inc 2023
