Wayland Development Getting Started with PipeWire Back to the Top PipeWire is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia pipelines.It provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine on top of audio and video devices that can be used to support the use cases currently handled by both pulseaudio and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from containerized applications easy. Nodes in the graph can be implemented as separate processes, communicating with sockets and exchanging multimedia content using fd passing. PipeWire was created by Wim Taymans, Principal Engineer at Red Hat and co-creator of the GStreamer multimedia framework. Key features of PipeWire include: - Capture and playback of audio and video with minimal latency. - Real-time Multimedia processing on audio and video. - Multiprocess architecture to let applications share multimedia content. - Seamless support for PulseAudio, JACK, ALSA and GStreamer applications.

Source: Collabora PipeWire Tools Back to the Top WirePlumber is a modular session / policy manager for PipeWire and a GObject-based high-level library that wraps PipeWire’s API, providing convenience for writing the daemon’s modules as well as external tools for managing PipeWire. The WirePlumber daemon implements the session & policy management service. It follows a modular design, having plugins that implement the actual management functionality. Core API is used by all clients that need to communicate with the PipeWire Daemon and provides the necessary structs to interface with the daemon. Implementation API is primarily used by the PipeWire Daemon itself but also by the PipeWire Session Manager and modules/extensions that need to build objects in the graph. SPA Simple Plugin API is an extensible API to implement all kinds of plugins. PipeWire-rs is a Rust bindings for pipewire and SPA libraries.

JACK Audio Connection Kit AKA JACK is a professional sound server daemon that provides real-time, low-latency connections for both audio and MIDI data between applications that implement its API. JACK can be configured to send audio data over a network to a main machine, which then outputs the audio to a physical device. This can be useful to mix audio from a number of linked computers without requiring additional cables or hardware mixers, and keeping the audio path digital for as long as possible. JACK2 is a C++ version of the JACK low-latency audio server for multi-processor machines. It is a new implementation of the JACK server core features that aims at removing some limitations of the JACK1 design.
