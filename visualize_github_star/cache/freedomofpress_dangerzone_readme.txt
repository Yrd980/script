Dangerzone Take potentially dangerous PDFs, office documents, or images and convert them to a safe PDF. | !Settings | !Converting |--|--| Dangerzone works like this: You give it a document that you don't know if you can trust for example, an email attachment. Inside of a sandbox, Dangerzone converts the document to a PDF if it isn't already one, and then converts the PDF into raw pixel data: a huge list of RGB color values for each page. Then, outside of the sandbox, Dangerzone takes this pixel data and converts it back into a PDF. Read more about Dangerzone in the official site. Getting started Follow the instructions for each platform: macOS Windows Ubuntu Linux Debian Linux Fedora Linux Qubes OS beta Tails You can read more about our operating system support here. Some features - Sandboxes don't have network access, so if a malicious document can compromise one, it can't phone home - Sandboxes use gVisor, an application kernel written in Go, that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system call interface. - Dangerzone can optionally OCR the safe PDFs it creates, so it will have a text layer again - Dangerzone compresses the safe PDF to reduce file size - After converting, Dangerzone lets you open the safe PDF in the PDF viewer of your choice, which allows you to open PDFs and office docs in Dangerzone by default so you never accidentally open a dangerous document Dangerzone can convert these types of document into safe PDFs: - PDF - Microsoft Word , - Microsoft Excel , - Microsoft PowerPoint , - ODF Text - ODF Spreadsheet - ODF Presentation - ODF Graphics - Hancom HWP Hangul Word Processor , Not supported on Qubes OS - EPUB - Jpeg , - GIF - PNG - SVG - other image formats , , , Dangerzone was inspired by Qubes trusted PDF, but it works in non-Qubes operating systems.
