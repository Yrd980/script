Cloud Native Landscape !Cloud Native Landscape Logo The CNCF Cloud Native Landscape is intended as a map through the previously uncharted terrain of cloud native technologies. This attempts to categorize most of the projects and product offerings in the cloud native space. There are many routes to deploying a cloud native application, with CNCF Projects representing a particularly well-traveled path. This repository contains the data files and images required to generate the CNCF landscape. The software that generates it can be found at the cncf/landscape2 repository. Please see its README file for more information about how it works. New entries To add a new entry to the landscape, please open a pull request to add it in alphabetical order to the landscape.yml file. The logo must be added to the directory in SVG format and referenced from the field. Before submitting a new entry it is important to review the following guidelines: Cloud native projects with at least 300 GitHub stars that clearly fit in an existing category are generally included. Put the project in the single category where it best fits. We generally will only list a company's product in one box, to represent its major or best-known offering. We occasionally make exceptions for large companies. Note that if we allowed listing the same product or project in multiple boxes, the over +1k logos on the landscape would multiply to many times that many. We are unlikely to create a new category for products/projects as we'd rather find the best home with the current options. We are generally not including commercial versions of open source software. The exception is that we are showing all Certified Kubernetes implementations. Closed source products need to link to a clear description of your product; no stealth mode companies. Crunchbase organization should be the company or organization that controls the software. That is normally the owner of the trademark, whether or not a trademark has been formally filed. Your project or company needs a logo in SVG format: Logos must include the company, product or project name in English. It's fine to also include words from another language. Don't use reversed logos i.e. with a non-white, non-transparent background color. When multiple variants exist, use stacked not horizontal logos. > !NOTE > At the moment the landscape is generated daily, so once your PR is merged your changes should be visible before 24 hours. Extra fields The section in the landscape.yml file allows you to include various fields to provide essential details about your project. This section helps users understand the project's purpose and find more information. For a detailed list of possible fields please refer to the Extra Fields Documentation. Technical Advisory Groups TAG Projects can specify which TAG owns them in the file. This can be achieved by setting the field in the item's section to one of the following values: When this information is not provided, we'll try to detect it automatically based on the TAGs configuration section of the settings file. The automatic detection is based on a pre-defined mapping between categories/subcategories and TAGs, so it may not be accurate in some cases. In those cases, the recommended approach is to provide the TAG manually as explained above. If you find an item with an incorrect TAG, we'd really appreciate if you could open a pull request to provide the correct one. Corrections If you find an error in the landscape, please open a pull request with the suggested changes to the landscape.yml file. Some information displayed in the landscape is obtained from Crunchbase or GitHub, so errors on it should be fixed in the corresponding source.
