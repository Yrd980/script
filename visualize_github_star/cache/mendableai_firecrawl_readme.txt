Featuring advanced scraping, crawling, and data extraction capabilities. This repository is in development, and weâ€™re still integrating custom modules into the mono repo. It's not fully ready for self-hosted deployment yet, but you can run it locally. What is Firecrawl? Firecrawl is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required. Check out our documentation. Pst. hey, you, join our stargazers : <a href="https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mendableai/firecrawl.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=2592000" alt="GitHub stars"> </a> How to use it? We provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation here. You can also self host the backend if you'd like. Check out the following resources to get started: - x API: Documentation - x SDKs: Python, Node, Go, Rust - x LLM Frameworks: Langchain python, Langchain js, Llama Index, Crew.ai, Composio, PraisonAI, Superinterface, Vectorize - x Low-code Frameworks: Dify, Langflow, Flowise AI, Cargo, Pipedream - x Others: Zapier, Pabbly Connect - Want an SDK or Integration? Let us know by opening an issue. To run locally, refer to guide here. API Key To use the API, you need to sign up on Firecrawl and get an API key. Features - Scrape: scrapes a URL and get its content in LLM-ready format markdown, structured data via LLM Extract, screenshot, html - Crawl: scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format - Map: input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast - Search: search the web and get full content from results - Extract: get structured data from single page, multiple pages or entire websites with AI. Powerful Capabilities - LLM-ready formats: markdown, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata - The hard stuff: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content js-rendered, output parsing, orchestration - Customizability: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etc... - Media parsing: pdfs, docx, images - Reliability first: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is - Actions: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data - Batching New: scrape thousands of URLs at the same time with a new async endpoint. You can find all of Firecrawl's capabilities and how to use them in our documentation Crawling Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl. Returns a crawl job id and the url to check the status of the crawl. Check Crawl Job Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result. Scraping Used to scrape a URL and get its content in the specified formats. Response: Map Used to map a URL and get urls of the website. This returns most links present on the website. Response: Map with search Map with param allows you to search for specific urls inside a website. Response will be an ordered list from the most relevant to the least relevant. Search Search the web and get full content from results Firecrawlâ€™s search API allows you to perform web searches and optionally scrape the search results in one operation. - Choose specific output formats markdown, HTML, links, screenshots - Search the web with customizable parameters language, country, etc. - Optionally retrieve content from search results in various formats - Control the number of results and set timeouts Response With content scraping Extract Beta Get structured data from entire websites with a prompt and/or a schema. You can extract structured data from one or multiple URLs, including wildcards: Single Page: Example: https://firecrawl.dev/some-page Multiple Pages / Full Domain Example: https://firecrawl.dev/ When you use /, Firecrawl will automatically crawl and parse all URLs it can discover in that domain, then extract the requested data. If you are using the sdks, it will auto pull the response for you: LLM Extraction Beta Used to extract structured data from scraped pages. Extracting without a schema New You can now extract without a schema by just passing a to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data. Interacting with the page with Actions Cloud-only Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction. Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot. Batch Scraping Multiple URLs New You can now batch scrape multiple URLs at the same time. It is very similar to how the /crawl endpoint works. It submits a batch scrape job and returns a job ID to check the status of the batch scrape. Using Python SDK Installing Python SDK Crawl a website Extracting structured data from a URL With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support pydantic schemas to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it: Using the Node SDK Installation To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm: Usage 1. Get an API key from firecrawl.dev 2. Set the API key as an environment variable named or pass it as a parameter to the class.
