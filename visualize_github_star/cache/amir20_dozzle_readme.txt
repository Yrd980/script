Dozzle - dozzle.dev Dozzle is a small lightweight application with a web based interface to monitor Docker logs. It doesn‚Äôt store any log files. It is for live monitoring of your container logs only. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66a7b4b2-d6c9-4fca-ab04-aef6cd7c0c31 !Docker Image Size latest by datehttps://hub.docker.com/r/amir20/dozzle/ !Docker Pullshttps://hub.docker.com/r/amir20/dozzle/ !Docker Versionhttps://hub.docker.com/r/amir20/dozzle/ !Test > !NOTE > If you like Dozzle, check out https://github.com/amir20/dtop which is a top like application for monitoring Docker containers. It integrates with Dozzle to allow for linking directly to container logs. Features - Intelligent fuzzy search for container names ü§ñ - Search logs using regex üî¶ - Search logs using SQL queries üìä - Small memory footprint üèé - Split screen for viewing multiple logs - Live stats with memory and CPU usage - Multi-user authentication with support for proxy forward authorization üö® - Swarm mode support üê≥ - Agent mode for monitoring multiple Docker hosts üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Dark mode üåô Dozzle has been tested with hundreds of containers. However, it doesn't support offline searching. Products like Loggly, Papertrail or Kibana are more suited for full search capabilities. Getting Started Dozzle is a small container 7 MB compressed. Pull the latest release with: $ docker pull amir20/dozzle:latest Running Dozzle The simplest way to use dozzle is to run the docker container. Also, mount the Docker Unix socket with to : $ docker run --name dozzle -d --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8080:8080 amir20/dozzle:latest Dozzle will be available at http://localhost:8080/. Here is the Docker Compose file: services: dozzle: containername: dozzle image: amir20/dozzle:latest volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ports: - 8080:8080 For advanced options like authentication, remote hosts or common questions see documentation at dozzle.dev. Swarm Mode Dozzle works with Docker Swarm mode. You can run Dozzle as a global service with: $ docker service create --name dozzle --env DOZZLEMODE=swarm --mode global --mount type=bind,source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock -p 8080:8080 amir20/dozzle:latest See the Swarm Mode documentation for more details. Agent Mode Dozzle can be used to monitor multiple Docker hosts. You can run Dozzle in agent mode with: $ docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 7007:7007 amir20/dozzle:latest agent See the Agent Mode documentation for more details. Technical Details Dozzle users automatic API negotiation which works with most Docker configurations. Dozzle also works with Colima and Podman. Installation on podman By default Podman doesn't have a background process but you can enable this for Dozzle to work. Verify first if your podman installation has enabled remote socket: When you get under the key remote socket output like this, its already enabled: If it's not enabled please follow this tutorial to enable it. Once you have the podman remote socket you can run Dozzle on podman. Additionally you have to create a fake engine-id to prevent errors. Podman doesn't generate an engine-id like Docker by itself due to its daemonless architecture. Under create a file named . On a system with Podman you will have to create the folder path as well. Inside the file place the UUID, for instance using . After that the file should have an identifier that looks like this: . For more details check Podman Infos or the FAQ Security Dozzle supports file based authentication and forward proxy like Authelia. These are documented at https://dozzle.dev/guide/authentication. Analytics collected Dozzle collects anonymous user configurations using Google Analytics. Why? Dozzle is an open source project with no funding. As a result, there is no time to do user studies of Dozzle. Analytics is collected to prioritize features and fixes based on how people use Dozzle. This data is completely public and can be viewed live using Data Studio dashboard. If you do not want to be tracked at all, see the flag below. Environment variables and configuration Dozzle follows the 12-factor model. Configurations can use the CLI flags or environment variables. See documentation at https://dozzle.dev/guide/supported-env-vars for more details. Support There are many ways you can support Dozzle: - Use it! Write about it! Star it!
