I have tested a lot of these, but not all. If you have any problems with the apps, please: -> head to the dev page if available -> make an issue for the dev there -> make an issue here so that I can consider whether I should remove the app from the list. Remember : Every piece of software has it's own merits, so there will never be anything like "best app" or "selective list" here, thank you. <br> License !Creative Commons Licensehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. oss icon: ./img/oss.svg freeware icon: ./img/freeware.svg money icon: ./img/money.svg
