However, if you are having trouble sending or receiving files, you may need to configure your firewall to allow LocalSend to communicate over your local network. | Traffic Type | Protocol | Port | Action | |--------------|----------|-------|--------| | Incoming | TCP, UDP | 53317 | Allow | | Outgoing | TCP, UDP | Any | Allow | Also make sure to disable AP isolation on your router. It should be usually disabled by default but some routers may have it enabled especially guest networks. See troubleshooting for more information. Portable Mode Introduced in v1.13.0 Create a file named located in the same directory as the executable. This file can be empty. The app will use this file to store settings instead of the default location. Start hidden Updated in v1.15.0 To start the app hidden only in tray, use the flag example: . On v1.14.0 and earlier, the app starts hidden if flag is set, and the hidden setting is enabled. How It Works LocalSend uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security. For more information on the LocalSend Protocol, see the documentation. Getting Started To compile LocalSend from the source code, follow these steps: 1. Install Flutter directly or using fvm see version required 2. Install Rust 3. Clone the repository 4. Run to enter the app directory 5. Run to download dependencies 6. Run to start the app > !NOTE > LocalSend currently requires an older Flutter version specified in .fvmrc > and thus build issues may be caused by a mismatch between the required and the system-wide installed Flutter version. > To make development more consistent, LocalSend uses fvm to manage the project Flutter version. > After installing , run instead of .
