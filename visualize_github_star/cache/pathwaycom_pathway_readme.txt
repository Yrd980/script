Pathway comes with an easy-to-use Python API, allowing you to seamlessly integrate your favorite Python ML libraries. Pathway code is versatile and robust: you can use it in both development and production environments, handling both batch and streaming data effectively. The same code can be used for local development, CI/CD tests, running batch jobs, handling stream replays, and processing data streams. Pathway is powered by a scalable Rust engine based on Differential Dataflow and performs incremental computation. Your Pathway code, despite being written in Python, is run by the Rust engine, enabling multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed computations. All the pipeline is kept in memory and can be easily deployed with Docker and Kubernetes. You can install Pathway with pip: For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord. Use-cases and templates Ready to see what Pathway can do? Try one of our easy-to-run examples! Available in both notebook and docker formats, these ready-to-launch examples can be launched in just a few clicks. Pick one and start your hands-on experience with Pathway today! Event processing and real-time analytics pipelines With its unified engine for batch and streaming and its full Python compatibility, Pathway makes data processing as easy as possible. It's the ideal solution for a wide range of data processing pipelines, including: - Showcase: Real-time ETL. - Showcase: Event-driven pipelines with alerting. - Showcase: Realtime analytics. - Docs: Switch from batch to streaming. AI Pipelines Pathway provides dedicated LLM tooling to build live LLM and RAG pipelines. Wrappers for most common LLM services and utilities are included, making working with LLMs and RAGs pipelines incredibly easy. Check out our LLM xpack documentation. Don't hesitate to try one of our runnable examples featuring LLM tooling. You can find such examples here. - Template: Unstructured data to SQL on-the-fly. - Template: Private RAG with Ollama and Mistral AI - Template: Adaptive RAG - Template: Multimodal RAG with gpt-4o Features - A wide range of connectors: Pathway comes with connectors that connect to external data sources such as Kafka, GDrive, PostgreSQL, or SharePoint. Its Airbyte connector allows you to connect to more than 300 different data sources. If the connector you want is not available, you can build your own custom connector using Pathway Python connector. - Stateless and stateful transformations: Pathway supports stateful transformations such as joins, windowing, and sorting. It provides many transformations directly implemented in Rust. In addition to the provided transformation, you can use any Python function. You can implement your own or you can use any Python library to process your data. - Persistence: Pathway provides persistence to save the state of the computation. This allows you to restart your pipeline after an update or a crash. Your pipelines are in good hands with Pathway! - Consistency: Pathway handles the time for you, making sure all your computations are consistent. In particular, Pathway manages late and out-of-order points by updating its results whenever new or late, in this case data points come into the system. The free version of Pathway gives the "at least once" consistency while the enterprise version provides the "exactly once" consistency. - Scalable Rust engine: with Pathway Rust engine, you are free from the usual limits imposed by Python. You can easily do multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed computations. - LLM helpers: Pathway provides an LLM extension with all the utilities to integrate LLMs with your data pipelines LLM wrappers, parsers, embedders, splitters, including an in-memory real-time Vector Index, and integrations with LLamaIndex and LangChain. You can quickly build and deploy RAG applications with your live documents. Getting started<a id="getting-started"></a> Installation<a id="installation"></a> Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above. You can install the current release of Pathway using : ⚠️ Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine. Example: computing the sum of positive values in real time.<a id="example"></a> Run Pathway in Google Colab. You can find more examples here. Deployment<a id="deployment"></a> Locally<a id="running-pathway-locally"></a> To use Pathway, you only need to import it: Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command: You can then run your Pathway project say, just like a normal Python script: . Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. <img src="https://d14l3brkh44201.cloudfront.net/pathway-dashboard.png" width="1326" alt="Pathway dashboard"/> Alternatively, you can use the pathway'ish version: Pathway natively supports multithreading. To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows: To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template. Docker<a id="docker"></a> You can easily run Pathway using docker. Pathway image You can use the Pathway docker image, using a Dockerfile: You can then build and run the Docker image: Run a single Python script When dealing with single-file projects, creating a full-fledged might seem unnecessary. In such scenarios, you can execute a Python script directly using the Pathway Docker image. For example: Python docker image You can also use a standard Python image and install Pathway using pip with a Dockerfile: Kubernetes and cloud<a id="k8s"></a> Docker containers are ideally suited for deployment on the cloud with Kubernetes. If you want to scale your Pathway application, you may be interested in our Pathway for Enterprise. Pathway for Enterprise is specially tailored towards end-to-end data processing and real time intelligent analytics. It scales using distributed computing on the cloud and supports distributed Kubernetes deployment, with external persistence setup. You can easily deploy Pathway using services like Render: see how to deploy Pathway in a few clicks. If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact us to learn more. Performance<a id="performance"></a> Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines. If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with. <img src="https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks/raw/main/images/bm-wordcount-lineplot.png" width="1326" alt="WordCount Graph"/> Documentation and Support<a id="resources"></a> The entire documentation of Pathway is available at pathway.com/developers/, including the API Docs.
