FreeCodeCamp - Building LLMs from Scratch Google Colab for those who don't have a GPU: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17TNpEEl8xjHlr9JzKbK5AuDKXwAkHqj?usp=sharing Dependencies assuming windows: If you don't have an NVIDIA GPU, then the parameter will default to since . If device is defaulting to that is fine, you will just experience slower runtimes. All the links you should need are in this repo. I will add detailed explanations as questions and issues are posted.
