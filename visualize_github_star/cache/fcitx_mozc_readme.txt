This OpenSource project originates from Google Japanese Input. Mozc is not an officially supported Google product.

Internal code name of Google Japanese Input that is still commonly used inside Google. 2. Project name to release a subset of Google Japanese Input in the form of source code under OSS license without any warranty nor user support. In this repository, Mozc means the second definition unless otherwise noted. Detailed differences between Google Japanese Input and Mozc are described in About Branding. Build Instructions ------------------ How to build Mozc for Android: for Android library How to build Mozc for Linux: for Linux desktop How to build Mozc for macOS: for macOS build How to build Mozc for Windows: for Windows Release Plan ------------ tl;dr. There is no stable version. As described in About Branding page, Google does not promise any official QA for OSS Mozc project. Because of this, Mozc does not have a concept of Stable Release. Instead we change version number every time when we introduce non-trivial change. If you are interested in packaging Mozc source code, or developing your own products based on Mozc, feel free to pick up any version. They should be equally stable or equally unstable in terms of no official QA process. Release History page may have additional information and useful links about recent changes.
