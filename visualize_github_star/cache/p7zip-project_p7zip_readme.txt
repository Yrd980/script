p7zip-zstd The original intention of p7zip is to make 7z run on unix-like systems. The latest 7zip already supports unix systems, so the new version of this project is not just a derivative of p7zip. It is also a derivative of 7zip. To distinguish it from the 7zip project, I decided to use p7zip-zstd to name the new version since this project is also a derivative of the 7-Zip-zstd project. Thanks to Igor Pavlov, author of 7zip, and Tino Reichardt, author of 7-Zip-zstd. and all 7zip community contributors and users. 7zz with extension method This is the place for 7zz Well known as 7zip-22.00 Linux version to include major modern codecs such as Brotli, Fast LZMA2, LZ4, LZ5, Lizard and Zstd. In order to support multithreading for those addional codecs, this project depends on the Multithreading Library. Codec overview 1. Zstandard v1.5.2 is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder. - Levels: 1..22 2. LZ4 v1.9.3 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core 0.16 Bytes/cycle. It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core 0.71 Bytes/cycle. A high compression derivative, called LZ4HC, is available, trading customizable CPU time for compression ratio. - Levels: 1..12 3. Fast LZMA2 v1.0.1 is a LZMA2 compression algorithm, 20% to 100% faster than normal LZMA2 at levels 5 and above, but with a slightly lower compression ratio. It uses a parallel buffered radix matchfinder and some optimizations from Zstandard. The codec uses much less additional memory per thread than standard LZMA2. - Levels: 1..9 4. Brotli v1.0.9 is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression. - Levels: 0..11 5. LZ5 v1.5 is a modification of LZ4 which gives a better ratio at cost of slower compression and decompression. - Levels: 1..15 6. Lizard v1.0 is an efficient compressor with very fast decompression. It achieves compression ratio that is comparable to zip/zlib and zstd/brotli at low and medium compression levels at decompression speed of 1000 MB/s and faster. - Levels 10..19 fastLZ4 are designed to give about 10% better decompression speed than LZ4 - Levels 20..29 LIZv1 are designed to give better ratio than LZ4 keeping 75% decompression speed - Levels 30..39 fastLZ4 + Huffman adds Huffman coding to fastLZ4 - Levels 40..49 LIZv1 + Huffman give the best ratio, comparable to zlib and low levels of zstd/brotli, but with a faster decompression speed 7. Lzham v10stable1 is a lossless data compression codec written in C/C++ specifically C++03, with a compression ratio similar to LZMA but with 1.5x-8x faster decompression speed. - Levels: 1..9 - Level: 1 best speed - Level: 9 best compression - Level: 10 best with extreme parsing can be very slow; not recommended Build Binary Currently only supports CLI, if you want to do GUI please contact us 1. Download src: 2. Use makefile to compile and build the binary 7zz: If you want build 7za: 7zr: or build 7z.so: 3. Install & Uninstall 4. Test: 5. The output should look like this: Check p7ziptestutils is a separate project. - Check Usage Usage - You can create files, with LZ4, Fast LZMA2, Brotli, LZ5, Lizard, Lzham and Zstandard method.
