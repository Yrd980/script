Arch Linux You can install from the official repositories with using pacman. Brew For macOS, you can install using by . Unstable To install the latest unstable version of Ducker, run the following command: Usage Ducker is comprised of a set of pages, each of which display specific information about and/or allow interaction with the docker containers and images on the host system. Top level pages can be navigated to with commands, input via the prompt. Pages can be interacted with using actions; these are input via hotkey inputs. A legend for common global hotkey inputs is displayed at the bottom of the screen; one for contextual eg different on each page hotkey inputs are displayed in the top right. Commands The following commands are supported: | Command | Aliases | Description | | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------ | | | | Open the top level page | | | | Open the top level page | | | | Open the top level page | | | | Open the top level page | | | | Close the application | Actions Global The following global actions are available on all pages: | Hotkey | Action | | ------- | ----------------------------------------- | | / | Navigate up in a list/table | | / | Navigate down in a list/table | | / | Close the application | | | Open the command prompt | | | Navigate to the bottom of a list or table | | | Navigate to the top of a list or table | Containers The following actions are available on the Containers page: | Hotkey | Action | | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | Delete the currently selected container | | | Exec into the currently selected container if container is running | | | View the logs for the currently selected container | | | Run the currently selected container | | | Stop the currently selected container | NB: exec currently only supports containers with bash installed. The intention is that this will be updated to provide a user option. Images The following actions are available on the Images page: | Hotkey | Action | | -------- | ------------------------------------- | | | Delete the currently selected image | | | Toggle dangling images | | | Describe the currently selected image | Volumes The following actions are available on the Volumes page: | Hotkey | Action | | -------- | -------------------------------------- | | | Delete the currently selected volume | | | Toggle dangling volumes | | | Describe the currently selected volume | Networks The following actions are available on the Networks page: | Hotkey | Action | | -------- | --------------------------------------- | | | Delete the currently selected network | | | Describe the currently selected network | > :warning: Network deletion isn't entirely complete: A failed deletion currently results in a yes/no modal telling you that it couldn't be deleted. There is no difference between the yes and no results. This is due to the current modal story and a quick and dirty hack to get them set up. Once a generic modal exists this will be patched up! Logs The following actions are available on the Logs page: | Hotkey | Action | | ------ | ----------------------------- | | | Return to the containers page | Sorting Hotkeys > Tip: Use + the indicated key to sort columns. > Pressing the same sorting key again will sort the same column in the opposite order toggle ascending/descending. > See the table below for each page's sort options. Containers | Hotkey | Action | | --------- | --------------- | | | Sort by name | | | Sort by image | | | Sort by status | | | Sort by created | | | Sort by ports | Images | Hotkey | Action | | --------- | --------------- | | | Sort by name | | | Sort by created | | | Sort by tag | | | Sort by size | Networks | Hotkey | Action | | --------- | --------------- | | | Sort by name | | | Sort by created | | | Sort by scope | | | Sort by driver | Volumes | Hotkey | Action | | --------- | ------------------ | | | Sort by name | | | Sort by created | | | Sort by driver | | | Sort by mountpoint | Configuration Ducker is configured via a yaml file found in the relevant config directory for host platform. On linux this is . The following table summarises the available config values: | Key | Default | Description | | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | prompt | ü¶Ü | The default prompt to display in the command pane | | defaultexec | | The default prompt to display in the command pane. NB - currently uses this for all exec's; it is planned to offer a choice | | dockerpath | | The location of the socket on which the docker daemon is exposed defaults to on windows | | checkforupdate | | When true, checks whether there is a newer version on load. If a newer version is found, indicates via note in bottom right. | | autocompleteminimumlength | 2 | The default minimum length before autocompletion in prompt. | | theme | See below | The colour theme configuration | If a value is unset or if the config file is unfound, Ducker will use the default values. If a value is malformed, Ducker will fail to run. To create a fully populated default config, run ducker with the flag; this will write the default config to the default location, overwriting any existing config. Themes By default, ducker uses the terminal emulator's preset colours. However, it is possible to set a custom colour theme in config. This is set in the section of the config file. The following table describes the theme options. The default theme provides the colours provided in the GIF in this README. | Key | Default | Description | | ------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | usetheme | | When uses the colour scheme defined in config, when uses the default terminal colours | | title | | The colour used for the Ducker font in the header | | help | | The colour used in the help prompts in the header | | background | | The colour used in the background | | footer | | The colour used for the text in the footer | | success | | The colour used for a successful result | | error | | The colour used for an error result | | positivehighlight | | The colour used for highlighting in a happy state | | negativehighlight | | The colour used for highlighting in a sad state | Tmux Some characters in ducker use italics/boldface. This doesn't work by default when running in tmux. To fix this, add the following to your add to tmux.conf
