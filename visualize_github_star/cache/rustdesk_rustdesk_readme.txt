Additionally, if you need to specify different arguments to the build command, you may do so at the end of the command in the position. For instance, if you wanted to build an optimized release version, you would run the command above followed by . The resulting executable will be available in the target folder on your system, and can be run with: Or, if you're running a release executable: Please ensure that you run these commands from the root of the RustDesk repository, or the application may not find the required resources. Also note that other cargo subcommands such as or are not currently supported via this method as they would install or run the program inside the container instead of the host.
