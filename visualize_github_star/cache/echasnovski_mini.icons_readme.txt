Demo !demo-iconsglyph-dark !demo-iconsascii !demo-iconsglyph-light Features - Provide icons with their highlighting via a single for various categories: filetype, file/directory path, extension, operating system, LSP kind values. Icons and category defaults can be overridden. - Configurable styles: "glyph" icon glyphs or "ascii" non-glyph fallback. - Fixed set of highlight groups linked to built-in groups by default for better blend with color scheme. - Caching for maximum performance. - Integration with and . - Mocking methods of 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' for better integrations with plugins outside 'mini.nvim'. See . - Tweaking built-in maps for "LSP kind" to include icons. In particular, this makes 'mini.completion' use icons in LSP step. See . Notes: - It is not a goal to become a collection of icons for as much use cases as possible. There are specific criteria for icon data to be included as built-in in each category see . The main supported category is "filetype". Recommendations for plugin authors using 'mini.icons' as a dependency: - Check if table is present which means that user explicitly enabled 'mini.icons' and provide icons only if it is. - Use function to get icon string and more data about it. - For file icons prefer using full path instead of relative or only basename. It makes a difference if path matches pattern that uses parent directories. The has an example of that. Dependencies Suggested dependencies: - Terminal emulator that supports showing special utf8 glyphs, possibly with "overflow" view displaying is done not in one but two visual cells. Most modern feature-rich terminal emulators support this out of the box: WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty, iTerm2, Ghostty. Not having "overflow" feature only results into smaller icons. Not having support for special utf8 glyphs will result into seemingly random symbols or question mark squares instead of icon glyphs. - Font that supports Nerd Fonts icons from version 3.0.0+ in particular class. This should be configured on terminal emulator level either by using font patched with Nerd Fonts icons or using https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases font as a fallback for glyphs that are not supported in main font. If using terminal emulator and/or font with icon support is impossible, use . It will use a less visually appealing set of non-glyph icons. Installation This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library recommended or as a standalone Git repository. There are two branches to install from: - default, recommended will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled. - will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in branch.
