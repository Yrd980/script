Make edits directly in the browser DOM with a visual editor. Design in realtime with code. An open-source alternative to Bolt.new, Lovable, V0, Replit Agent, Figma Make, Webflow, etc. 🚧 🚧 🚧 Onlook is still under development 🚧 🚧 🚧 We're actively looking for contributors to help make Onlook for Web an incredible prompt-to-build experience. Check the open issues for a full list of proposed features and known issues, and join our Discord to collaborate with hundreds of other builders. What you can do with Onlook: - x Create Next.js app in seconds - x Start from text or image - Use prebuilt templates - Import from Figma - Start from GitHub repo - x Visually edit your app - x Use Figma-like UI - x Preview your app in real-time - x Manage brand assets and tokens - x Create and navigate to Pages - x Browse layers - x Manage project Images - Detect and use Components – Previously in Onlook Desktop - x Development Tools - x Real-time code editor - x Save and restore from checkpoints - x Run commands via CLI - x Connect with app marketplace - x Deploy your app in seconds - x Generate sharable links - x Link your custom domain - Collaborate with your team - Real-time editing - Leave comments !Onlook-GitHub-Example Getting Started Available soon with a hosted app or run locally. Usage Onlook will run on any Next.js + TailwindCSS project, import your project into Onlook or start from scratch within the editor. Use the AI chat to create or edit a project you're working on. At any time, you can always right-click an element to open up the exact location of the element in code. <img width="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad9f411-b172-4430-81ef-650f4f314666" /> <br> Draw-in new divs and re-arrange them within their parent containers by dragging-and-dropping. <img width="600" alt="image" src="assets/insert-div.png"> <br> Preview the code side-by-side with your site design. <img width="600" alt="image" src="assets/code-connect.png"> <br> Use Onlook's editor toolbar to adjust Tailwind styles, directly manipulate objects, and experiment with layouts. <img width="600" alt="image" src="assets/text-styling.png" /> Documentation For full documentation, visit docs.onlook.com To see how to Contribute, visit Contributing to Onlook in our docs. How it works <img width="676" alt="architecture" src="assets/architecture.png"> 1. When you create an app, we load the code into a web container 2. The container runs and serves the code 3. Our editor receives the preview link and displays it in an iFrame 4. Our editor reads and indexes the code from the container 5. We instrument the code in order to map elements to their place in code 6. When the element is edited, we edit the element in our iFrame, then in code 7. Our AI chat also has code access and tools to understand and edit the code This architecture can theoretically scale to any language or framework that displays DOM elements declaratively e.g. jsx/tsx/html. We are focused on making it work well with Next.js and TailwindCSS for now. For a full walkthrough, check out our Architecture Docs.
