You can deploy it with one click using <img src="./assets/aliyun.png" width="14px" style="display:inline;"> Alibaba Cloud's FunctionAI in ten minutes! - 🔥🔥🔥We release WebSailor, an agentic search model specialized in performing extremely complex information seeking tasks, achieving open-source SOTA on some of the most difficult browsing benchmarks. WebSailor topped the HuggingFace daily papers. - 🔥🔥🔥The model, interactive demo, and some of the data of WebDancer have been open-sourced. You're welcome to try them out! You can deploy it with one click using <img src="./assets/aliyun.png" width="14px" style="display:inline;"> Alibaba Cloud's FunctionAI in ten minutes! - 🔥🔥🔥We release WebDancer, a native agentic search model towards autonomous information seeking agency and Deep Research-like model. - WebWalker is accepted by ACL 2025 main conference. - We release WebWalker, a benchmark for LLMs in web traversal and a multi-agent framework for information seeking. 💎 Results Showcase <div align="center"> <p align="center"> <img src="assets/webagent-gaia.png" width="800%" height="400%" /> </p> </div> <div align="center"> <p align="center"> <img src="assets/webagent-bc.png" width="800%" height="400%" /> </p> </div> 💡 Features for WebShaper - A data synthesis method for information-seeking agents, grounded in our proposed task formalization. Leveraging this method, we construct the WebShaper dataset, which enables systematic generation of IS instances. - We propose an agentic Expander that iteratively generates and validates questions in alignment with the formalization. - We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of WebShaper. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on GAIA 60.19 and WebWalkerQA 52.50 benchmarks. ⛵️ Features for WebSailor - A complete post-training methodology enabling models to engage in extended thinking and information seeking, ultimately allowing them to successfully complete extremely complex tasks previously considered unsolvable. - Introduces SailorFog-QA, a scalable QA benchmark with high uncertainty and difficulty, curated with a novel data synthesis method through graph sampling and information obfuscation. Example SailorFog-QA data samples can be found at: WebSailor/dataset/sailorfog-QA.jsonl - Effective post-training pipeline consisting of 1 high-quality reconstruction of concise reasoning from expert trajectories for clean supervision, 2 a two-stage training process involving an RFT cold start stage, followed by Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization DUPO, an efficient agentic RL algorithm excelling in effectiveness and efficiency. - WebSailor-72B significantly outperforms all open-source agents and frameworks while closing the performance gap with leading proprietary systems, achieving a score of 12.0% on BrowseComp-en, 30.1% on BrowseComp-zh, and 55.4% on GAIA. - The checkpoint is coming soon. 🌐 Features for WebDancer - Native agentic search reasoning model using ReAct framework towards autonomous information seeking agency and Deep Research-like model. - We introduce a four-stage training paradigm comprising browsing data construction, trajectory sampling, supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and reinforcement learning for improved generalization, enabling the agent to autonomously acquire autonomous search and reasoning skills. - Our data-centric approach integrates trajectory-level supervision fine-tuning and reinforcement learning DAPO to develop a scalable pipeline for training agentic systems via SFT or RL. - WebDancer achieves a Pass@3 score of 64.1% on GAIA and 62.0% on WebWalkerQA. 🚀 Quick Start You need to enter the WebDancer folder for the following commands. Step 0: Set Up the Environment Step 1: Deploy the Model Download the WebDancer model from 🤗 HuggingFace and deploy it using the provided scripts with sglang. > Note: Replace with the actual path to the downloaded model. Step 2: Run the Demo Edit the following keys in WebDancer/scripts/rundemo.sh: - , you can get it from serper. - , you can get it from jina. - , you can get it from dashscope. Then, launch the demo with Gradio to interact with the WebDancer model: 🎥 WebSailor Demos We provide demos for BrowseComp-en, BrowseComp-zh and Daily Use. Our model can complete highly difficult and uncertain tasks requiring massive information acquisition and complex reasoning. <div align="center"> <h3>BrowseComp-en</h3> <video src= "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dc0b03a-c241-4f70-bf11-92fda28020fa"/> </div> <div align="center"> <h3>BrowseComp-zh</h3> <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9aed746-ffc8-4b76-b135-715ec0eab544" /> </div> <div align="center"> <h3>Daily Use</h3> <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1299c5a8-cee3-4a70-b68b-c5d227cf8055" /> </div> 🎥 WebDancer Demos We provide demos for WebWalkerQA, GAIA and Daily Use.
