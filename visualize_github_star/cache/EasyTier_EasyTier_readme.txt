When you don't have a public IP, you can use the free shared nodes provided by the EasyTier community. Nodes will automatically attempt NAT traversal and establish P2P connections. When P2P fails, data will be relayed through shared nodes. The currently deployed shared public node is . When using shared nodes, each node entering the network needs to provide the same and parameters as the unique identifier of the network. Taking two nodes as an example Please use more complex network name to avoid conflicts: 1. Run on Node A: 2. Run on Node B: After successful execution, you can check the network status using : You can test connectivity between nodes: Note: If you cannot ping through, it may be that the firewall is blocking incoming traffic. Please turn off the firewall or add allow rules. To improve availability, you can connect to multiple shared nodes simultaneously: Once your network is set up successfully, you can easily configure it to start automatically on system boot. Refer to the One-Click Register Service guide for step-by-step instructions on registering EasyTier as a system service. Decentralized Networking EasyTier is fundamentally decentralized, with no distinction between server and client. As long as one device can communicate with any node in the virtual network, it can join the virtual network. Here's how to set up a decentralized network: 1. Start First Node Node A: After startup, this node will listen on the following ports by default: - TCP: 11010 - UDP: 11010 - WebSocket: 11011 - WebSocket SSL: 11012 - WireGuard: 11013 2. Connect Second Node Node B: 3. Verify Connection: For more nodes to join the network, they can connect to any existing node in the network using the parameter: 🔍 Advanced Features Subnet Proxy Assuming the network topology is as follows, Node B wants to share its accessible subnet 10.1.1.0/24 with other nodes: To share a subnet, add the parameter when starting EasyTier: Subnet proxy information will automatically sync to each node in the virtual network, and each node will automatically configure the corresponding route. You can verify the subnet proxy setup: 1. Check if the routing information has been synchronized the proxycidrs column shows the proxied subnets: !Routing Information 2. Test if you can access nodes in the proxied subnet: WireGuard Integration EasyTier can act as a WireGuard server, allowing any device with a WireGuard client including iOS and Android to access the EasyTier network. Here's an example setup: 1. Start EasyTier with WireGuard portal enabled: 2. Get WireGuard client configuration: 3. In the output configuration: - Set to an available IP from the WireGuard subnet - Set to the public IP/domain of your EasyTier node - Import the modified configuration into your WireGuard client Self-Hosted Public Shared Node You can run your own public shared node to help other nodes discover each other. A public shared node is just a regular EasyTier network with same network name and secret that other networks can connect to. To run a public shared node: Related Projects - ZeroTier: A global virtual network for connecting devices. - TailScale: A VPN solution aimed at simplifying network configuration. - vpncloud: A P2P Mesh VPN - Candy: A reliable, low-latency, and anti-censorship virtual private network Contact Us - 💬 Telegram Group - 👥 QQ Group: 949700262 License EasyTier is released under the LGPL-3.0.
