Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? Are you kidding me? To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any further but contains code you don't want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file by hand? Are you KIDDING me?! Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren't even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! If you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.

You can also press to select the entirety of the current hunk. !stagelines Interactive Rebase Press to start an interactive rebase. Then squash , fixup , drop , edit , move up or move down any of TODO commits, before continuing the rebase by bringing up the rebase options menu with and then selecting . You can also perform any these actions as a once-off e.g. pressing on a commit to squash it without explicitly starting a rebase. This demo also uses shift+down to select a range of commits to move and fixup. !interactiverebase Cherry-pick Press on a commit to copy it and press to paste cherry-pick it. !cherrypick Bisect Press in the commits view to mark a commit as good/bad in order to begin a git bisect. !bisect Nuke the working tree For when you really want to just get rid of anything that shows up when you run and yes that includes dirty submodules kidpix style, press to bring up the reset options menu and then select the 'nuke' option. !Nuke working tree Amend an old commit Pressing on any commit will amend that commit with the currently staged changes running an interactive rebase in the background. !amendoldcommit Filter You can filter a view with . Here we filter down our branches view and then hit to view its commits. !filter Invoke a custom command Lazygit has a very flexible custom command system. In this example a custom command is defined which emulates the built-in branch checkout action. !customcommand Worktrees You can create worktrees to have multiple branches going at once without the need for stashing or creating WIP commits when switching between them. Press in the branches view to create a worktree from the selected branch and switch to it. !worktreecreatefrombranches Rebase magic custom patches You can build a custom patch from an old commit and then remove the patch from the commit, split out a new commit, apply the patch in reverse to the index, and more. In this example we have a redundant comment that we want to remove from an old commit. We hit on the commit to view its files, then on a file to focus the patch, then to add the comment line to our custom patch, and then to view the custom patch options; selecting to remove the patch from the current commit. Learn more in the Rebase magic Youtube tutorial. !custompatch Rebase from marked base commit Say you're on a feature branch that was itself branched off of the develop branch, and you've decided you'd rather be branching off the master branch. You need a way to rebase only the commits from your feature branch. In this demo we check to see which was the last commit on the develop branch, then press to mark that commit as our base commit, then press on the master branch to rebase onto it, only bringing across the commits from our feature branch. Then we push our changes with . !rebaseonto Undo You can undo the last action by pressing and redo with . Here we drop a couple of commits and then undo the actions. Undo uses the reflog which is specific to commits and branches so we can't undo changes to the working tree or stash. More info !undo Commit graph When viewing the commit graph in an enlarged window use and to cycle screen modes, the commit graph is shown. Colours correspond to the commit authors, and as you navigate down the graph, the parent commits of the selected commit are highlighted. !commitgraph Compare two commits If you press on a commit or branch/ref a menu will open that allows you to mark that commit so that any other commit you select will be diffed against it. Once you've selected the second commit, you'll see the diff in the main view and if you press you'll see the files of the diff. You can press to view the diff menu again to see options like reversing the diff direction or exiting diff mode. You can also exit diff mode by pressing . !diffcommits Tutorials <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sVEktDn.png"> - 15 Lazygit Features in 15 Minutes - Basics Tutorial - Rebase Magic Tutorial Installation !Packaging statushttps://repology.org/project/lazygit/versions Most of the above packages are maintained by third parties so be sure to vet them yourself and confirm that the maintainer is a trustworthy looking person who attends local sports games and gives back to their communities with barbeque fundraisers etc Binary Releases For Windows, Mac OS10.12+ or Linux, you can download a binary release here. Homebrew It works with Linux, too. MacPorts Latest version built from github releases. Tap: Void Linux Packages for Void Linux are available in the distro repo They follow upstream latest releases Scoop Windows You can install using scoop. It's in the bucket: Arch Linux Packages for Arch Linux are available via pacman and AUR Arch User Repository. There are two packages. The stable one which is built with the latest release and the git version which builds from the most recent commit. - Stable: - Development: <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazygit-git/> Instruction of how to install AUR content can be found here: <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ArchUserRepository> Fedora / Amazon Linux 2023 / CentOS Stream Packages for Fedora, Amazon Linux 2023 and CentOS Stream are available via Copr Cool Other Package Repo. These packages are built using the RPM spec file located here: https://codeberg.org/dejan/rpm-lazygit You should be able to build RPMs for Fedora 41 or older, and other Fedora derivatives using the SRPM Source RPM file that you can grab from the latest COPR build. Solus Linux Debian and Ubuntu For Debian 13 "Trixie", Sid, and later, or Ubuntu 25.10 "Questing Quokka" and later: For Debian 12 "Bookworm", Ubuntu 25.04 "Plucky Puffin" and earlier: Verify the correct installation of lazygit: Funtoo Linux Funtoo Linux has an autogenerated lazygit package in dev-kit: Gentoo Linux Lazygit is not yet in main Gentoo portage, however an ebuild is available in GURU overlay You can either add the overlay to your system and install lazygit as usual: openSUSE The lazygit package is currently built in devel:languages:go/lazygit. To install lazygit on openSUSE Tumbleweed run: To install lazygit on openSUSE Leap run: NixOs On NixOs lazygit is packaged with nix and distributed via nixpkgs. You can try the lazygit without installing it with: Or you can add lazygit to you using the option. More details can be found via NixOs search page. Flox Lazygit can be installed into a Flox environment as follows. More details about Flox can be found on their website. FreeBSD Termux Conda Released versions are available for different platforms, see <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lazygit> Go Please note: If you get an error claiming that lazygit cannot be found or is not defined, you may need to add to your $PATH MacOS/Linux, or Windows.

If you want, you can also add an alias for this with or whichever rc file you're using. Keybindings You can check out the list of keybindings here. Changing Directory On Exit If you change repos in lazygit and want your shell to change directory into that repo on exiting lazygit, add this to your or other rc file: Then and from now on when you call and exit you'll switch directories to whatever you were in inside lazygit. To override this behaviour you can exit using rather than just . Undo/Redo See the docs Configuration Check out the configuration docs. Custom Pagers See the docs Custom Commands If lazygit is missing a feature, there's a good chance you can implement it yourself with a custom command! See the docs Git flow support Lazygit supports Gitflow if you have it installed. To understand how the Gitflow model works check out Vincent Driessen's original post explaining it. To view Gitflow options from within Lazygit, press from within the branches view. Contributing We love your input! Please check out the contributing guide.
