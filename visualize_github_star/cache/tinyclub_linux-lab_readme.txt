Welcome to take a look at the systems running Linux Lab016 and share yours, for example: $ cd /path/to/cloud-lab $ tools/docker/env System: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS Linux: 4.4.0-176-generic Docker: Docker version 18.09.4, build d14af54 2.2 Docker Installation Docker is required by Linux Lab, please install it at first: - Linux, Mac OSX, Windows 10 Docker CE026 - older Windows include some older Windows 10 Docker Toolbox011; Install Ubuntu via Virtualbox or Vmware Virtual Machine Before running Linux Lab, please refer to section 6.1.4 and make sure the following command works without sudo and without any issue: $ docker run hello-world In China, to use docker service normally, please must configure one of chinese docker mirror sites, for example: Aliyun Docker Mirror Documentation018 For non Univerisity users, require login with freely registered account USTC Docker Mirror Documentation020 For Univerisity users More docker related issues, such as download slowly, download timeout and download errors, are cleary documented in the 6.1 section of FAQs. The other issues, please read the official docker docs007. Notes for Ubuntu Users - doc/install/ubuntu-docker.md003 Notes for Arch Users - doc/install/arch-docker.md001 Notes for Manjaro Users - doc/install/manjaro-docker.md002 Notes for Windows Users: - Please make sure your Windows version support docker: Official Docker Documentation007 and determine Docker Desktop or Docker Toolbox should be used - Linux Lab only tested with 'Git Bash' in Windows, please must use with it - After installing Git For Windows017, "Git Bash Here" will come out in right-button press menu 2.3 Choose a working directory Please simply choose one directory in or or create a new directory. $ mkdir ~/Develop $ cd ~/Develop For Windows and Mac OSX, to compile Linux normally, please refer to section 5.7.1 and enable building cache: 2.4 Switch to normal user Before downloading Linux Lab, please MUST switch to normal user. Check who am i, means root, non-zero means normal user: $ id -u 1000 If current user is , switch to a normal one: id -u 0 sudo -su <USER> If no normal user exists, create new: $ sudo useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash --user-group --groups adm,sudo laber $ sudo passwd laber $ sudo -su laber $ whoami laber 2.5 Download the lab Use Ubuntu system as an example: Download cloud lab framework with normal user, pull images and checkout linux-lab repository: $ git clone https://gitee.com/tinylab/cloud-lab.git $ cd cloud-lab/ If cloned source code with account, please MUST switch to normal user and change their owner: $ sudo -su <USER> $ sudo chown -R <USER>:<USER> -R cloud-lab/,.git 2.6 Run and login the lab Launch the lab and login with the user and password printed in the console: $ tools/docker/run linux-lab Login with Bash: $ tools/docker/bash Re-login the lab via web browser: $ tools/docker/webvnc The other login methods: $ tools/docker/vnc $ tools/docker/ssh $ tools/docker/webssh Choose one of the methods: $ tools/docker/login list List, choose and record $ tools/docker/login vnc Choose one directly and record for late login Summary of login methods: | Login Method | Description | Default User | Where | |--------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------| | bash | docker bash | Ubuntu | localhost | | ssh | normal ssh | Ubuntu | localhost | | vnc | normal vnc | Ubuntu | localhost+VNC client | | webvnc | web desktop | Ubuntu | anywhere via internet | | webssh | web ssh | Ubuntu | anywhere via internet | Since vnc clients differs from operating systems, we use webvnc by default to make sure auto login vnc for all systems. If really want to use local vnc clients, please install a vnc client, for example: , then specify it like this: $ tools/docker/vnc vinagre If the above command not work normally, based on the information printed above, please configure the vnc client yourself. Notes: vinagre has fullscreen mode, but not enabled by default, which can be enabled through menu: , but must enable at first, otherwise, no way exit fullscreen except via . The directly connected ssh and vnc may not always work, please use one of the other three methods instead. 2.7 Update and rerun the lab Usually, only need to update Linux Lab itself, to get the new boards support or related fixups: $ cd /path/to/cloud-lab/labs/linux-lab/ $ git checkout master $ git pull Sometimes, need to update Cloud Lab, to fix up potential running issues or getting newer docker image: $ cd /path/to/cloud-lab $ git checkout master $ git pull If modified the running environment of Linux Lab locally and want to reuse it in the future, save the container very slow, not recommend if not necessary: $ tools/docker/save linux-lab $ git checkout -- configs/linux-lab/docker/name Then rerurn Linux lab: $ tools/docker/rerun linux-lab 2.8 Quickstart: Boot a board Get into the lab environment, switch directory: $ cd /labs/linux-lab Issue the following command to boot the prebuilt kernel and rootfs on the default board: $ make boot Login as user without passwordpassword is empty, just input and press Enter: Welcome to Linux Lab linux-lab login: root uname -a Linux linux-lab 5.1.0 3 SMP Thu May 30 08:44:37 UTC 2019 armv7l GNU/Linux poweroff Shutdown the board with the command. Notes: If some boards not support , please press . Of course, open another terminal and issue kill or pkill command also can quit qemu. 3.

Only list real boards: $ make list-real arm/ebf-imx6ull : ARCH = arm CPU ?= cortex-a9 LINUX ?= v4.19.35 ROOTDEVLIST := /dev/mmcblk0 /dev/ram0 /dev/nfs ROOTDEV ?= /dev/mmcblk0 Because real hardware boards differs from each other, so, board specific document are recommended, for example: . !Linux Lab Board - IMX6ULL023 3.1.2.2 Virtual board By default, the default virtual board: is used, we can configure, build and boot for a specific board with , for example: $ make BOARD=malta $ make boot If several boards have the same name, please specify the architecture to distinguish: $ make BOARD=mipsel/malta Currently, such boards have the same name: $ make list FILTER=virt aarch64/virt : ARCH = arm64 CPU ?= cortex-a57 LINUX ?= v5.1 ROOTDEVLIST := /dev/sda /dev/vda /dev/ram0 /dev/nfs ROOTDEV ?= /dev/vda riscv32/virt : ARCH = riscv CPU ?= any LINUX ?= v5.0.13 ROOTDEVLIST := /dev/vda /dev/ram0 /dev/nfs ROOTDEV ?= /dev/vda riscv64/virt : ARCH = riscv CPU ?= any LINUX ?= v5.1 ROOTDEVLIST := /dev/vda /dev/ram0 /dev/nfs ROOTDEV ?= /dev/vda $ make list FILTER=/pc i386/pc : ARCH = x86 CPU ?= qemu32 LINUX ?= v5.1 ROOTDEVLIST ?= /dev/hda /dev/ram0 /dev/nfs ROOTDEVLISTLINUXv2.6.34.9 ?= /dev/sda /dev/ram0 /dev/nfs ROOTDEV ?= /dev/hda x8664/pc : ARCH = x86 CPU ?= qemu64 LINUX ?= v5.1 ROOTDEVLIST := /dev/hda /dev/ram0 /dev/nfs ROOTDEVLISTLINUXv3.2 := /dev/sda /dev/ram0 /dev/nfs ROOTDEV ?= /dev/ram0 Use them like this: $ make BOARD=x8664/pc $ make BOARD=riscv64/virt If using , it only works on-the-fly, the setting will not be saved, this is helpful to run multiple boards at the same and not to disrupt each other: $ make board=malta boot This allows to run multi boards in different terminals or background at the same time. Check the board specific configuration: $ cat boards/arm/vexpress-a9/Makefile Notes: More money are required to maintain this project, only one virtual board is free now, the others are non-free, buy one as you want. 3.1.2.3 Buy one All supported real hardware boards, virtual hardware boards support and the related Linux Lab Disk will be put in TinyLab.org's Taobao Shop024 or Bilibili Shop025, after bought them, please contact with wechat: and join in the development group. 3.1.3 Using as plugins The 'Plugin' feature is supported by Linux Lab, to allow boards being added and maintained in standalone git repositories. Standalone repository is very important to ensure Linux Lab itself not grow up big and big while more and more boards being added in. Book examples or the boards with a whole new CPU architecture benefit from such feature a lot, for book examples may use many boards and a new CPU architecture may need require lots of new packages such as cross toolchains and the architecture specific QEMU system tool. Here maintains the available plugins: - C-Sky Linux013 - Loongson Linux012 The Loongson plugin has been merged into v5.0. 3.1.4 Configure boards Every board has its own configuration, some can be changed on demand, for example, memory size, linux version, buildroot version, qemu version and the other external devices, such as serial port, network devices and so on. The configure method is very simple, just edit it by referring to current values , this command open local configuration via vim: $ make edit But please don't make a big change once, we often only need to tune Linux version, this command is better for such case: $ make list-linux v4.12 v4.5.5 v5.0.10 v5.1 $ make config LINUX=v5.0.10 $ make list-linux v4.12 v4.5.5 v5.0.10 v5.1 If want to upstream your local changes, please use and , otherwise, and are preferrable, for they will avoid conflicts while pulling remote updates. 3.2 Build in one command v0.3+ version add target dependency by default, so, if want to compile a kernel, just run: $ make kernel-build Or $ make build kernel It will do everything required, of course, we still be able to run the targets explicitly. And futher, with the timestamping support, finished targets will not be run again during the late operations, if still want, just clean the stamp and run it again: $ make cleanstamp kernel-build $ make kernel-build Or $ make force-kernel-build To clean all of the stamp files: $ make cleanstamp kernel This function also support uboot, root and qemu. 3.3 Detailed Operations 3.3.1 Downloading Download board specific package and the kernel, buildroot source code: $ make source APP=bsp,kernel,root,uboot Or $ make source APP=all Or $ make source all Download one by one: $ make bsp-source $ make kernel-source $ make root-source $ make uboot-source Or $ make source bsp $ make source kernel $ make source root $ make source uboot After v0.5, the source code are downloaded in , before, they are saved in the root directory of Linux Lab. Notes: the source code will be downloaded to when or is configured to 1, please save or backup the data inside manually, otherwise, they will be lost after system poweroff. 3.3.2 Checking out Checkout the target version of kernel and builroot: $ make checkout APP=kernel,root Checkout them one by one: $ make kernel-checkout $ make root-checkout Or $ make checkout kernel $ make checkout root If checkout not work due to local changes, save changes and run to get a clean environment: $ make kernel-cleanup $ make root-cleanup Or $ make cleanup kernel $ make cleanup root The same to QEMU and U-Boot. 3.3.3 Patching Apply available patches in and : $ make kernel-patch Or $ make patch kernel 3.3.4 Configuration 3.3.4.1 Default Configuration Configure kernel and buildroot with defconfig: $ make defconfig APP=kernel,root Configure one by one, by default, use the defconfig in : $ make kernel-defconfig $ make root-defconfig Or $ make defconfig kernel $ make defconfig root Configure with specified defconfig: $ make B=raspi3 $ make kernel-defconfig bcmrpi3defconfig $ make root-defconfig raspberrypi364defconfig If only defconfig name specified, search boards/<BOARD> at first, and then the default configs path of buildroot, u-boot and linux-stable respectivly: src/buildroot/configs, src/u-boot/configs, src/linux-stable/arch/<ARCH>/configs. 3.3.4.2 Manual Configuration $ make kernel-menuconfig $ make root-menuconfig Or $ make menuconfig kernel $ make menuconfig root 3.3.4.3 Old default configuration $ make kernel-olddefconfig $ make root-olddefconfig $ make uboot-olddefconfig Or $ make olddefconfig kernel $ make olddefconfig root $ make olddefconfig uboot 3.3.5 Building Build kernel and buildroot together: $ make build APP=kernel,root Build them one by one: $ make kernel-build make kernel $ make root-build make root Or $ make build kernel $ make build root After v0.5, the building result are stored in , before they are put in . 3.3.6 Saving Save all of the configs and rootfs/kernel/dtb images: $ make save APP=kernel,root $ make saveconfig APP=kernel,root Save configs and images to : $ make kernel-saveconfig $ make root-saveconfig $ make root-save $ make kernel-save Or $ make saveconfig kernel $ make saveconfig root $ make save kernel $ make save root 3.3.7 Booting Boot with serial port nographic by default, exit with , , or See poweroff hang: $ make boot Boot with graphic Exit with : $ make b=pc boot G=1 LINUX=v5.1 BUILDROOT=2019.11 $ make b=versatilepb boot G=1 LINUX=v5.1 BUILDROOT=2016.05 $ make b=g3beige boot G=1 LINUX=v5.1 BUILDROOT=2016.05 $ make b=malta boot G=1 LINUX=v2.6.36 BUILDROOT=2016.05 $ make b=vexpress-a9 boot G=1 LINUX=v4.6.7 BUILDROOT=2016.05 // LINUX=v3.18.39 works too Note: real graphic boot require LCD and keyboard drivers, the above boards work well, with Linux v5.1, and has tty0 console but without keyboard input. new buildroot config files set tty console to serial with , to enable console with G=1, please change the line in , for example, replace with , we can also simply switch to the serial console via the Qemu 'View' menu. and has no LCD support by default, but for the latest qemu, it is able to boot with G=1 and switch to serial console via the 'View' menu, this can not be used to test LCD and keyboard drivers. specify the additional QEMU options. $ make b=vexpress-a9 CONSOLE=ttyAMA0 boot G=1 LINUX=v5.1 $ make b=raspi3 CONSOLE=ttyAMA0 QOPTS="-serial vc -serial vc" boot G=1 LINUX=v5.1 Boot with curses graphic friendly to bash/ssh login, not work for all boards, exit with or : $ make b=pc boot G=2 LINUX=v4.6.7 Boot with PreBuilt Kernel, Dtb and Rootfs: $ make boot kernel=old dtb=old root=old Boot with new kernel, dtb and rootfs if exists: $ make boot kernel=new dtb=new root=new Boot with new kernel and uboot, build them if not exists: $ make boot BUILD=kernel,uboot Boot without Uboot only and boards tested: $ make boot U=0 Boot with different rootfs depends on board, check after boot: $ make boot ROOTDEV=ram0 // support by all boards, basic boot method $ make boot ROOTDEV=nfs // depends on network driver, only raspi3 not work $ make boot ROOTDEV=sda $ make boot ROOTDEV=mmcblk0 $ make boot ROOTDEV=vda // virtio based block device Boot with extra kernel command line KCLI = Additional Kernel Command LIne: $ make boot ROOTDEV=nfs KCLI="init=/bin/bash" List supported options: $ make list ROOTDEV $ make list BOOTDEV $ make list CCORI $ make list NETDEV $ make list linux $ make list uboot $ make list qemu And more are also supported with , for example: $ make list features $ make list modules $ make list gcc 4. Linux Lab Advance 4.1 Using Linux Kernel 4.1.1 non-interactive configuration A tool named in Linux kernel is helpful to get/set the kernel config options non-interactively, based on it, both of and are added to tune the kernel options, with them, we can simply "enable/disable/setstr/setval/getstate" of a kernel option or many at the same time: Get state of a kernel module: $ make kernel-getconfig m=minixfs Getting kernel config: MINIXFS ... build/aarch64/linux-v5.1-virt/.config:CONFIGMINIXFS=m Enable a kernel module: $ make kernel-setconfig m=minixfs Setting kernel config: m=minixfs ... build/aarch64/linux-v5.1-virt/.config:CONFIGMINIXFS=m Enable new kernel config: minixfs ... More control commands of including : | Option | Description | |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------| | | build the modules in kernel or enable anther kernel options. | | | build the modules as pluginable modules, just like . | | | build the modules as pluginable modules, just like . | | | disable a kernel option. | | | , set the rtc device to rtc0 | | | , set the kernel panic timeout to 5 secs. | Operates many options in one command line: $ make kernel-setconfig m=tun,minixfs y=ikconfig v=panictimeout=5 s=DEFAULTHOSTNAME=linux-lab n=debuginfo $ make kernel-getconfig o=tun,minix,ikconfig,panictimeout,hostname 4.1.2 using kernel modules Build all internel kernel modules: $ make modules $ make modules-install $ make root-rebuild // not need for nfs boot $ make boot List available modules in , : $ make modules-list If argument specified, list available modules in , and : $ make modules-list m=hello 1 m=hello ; M=$PWD/src/modules/hello $ make modules-list m=tun,minix 1 c=TUN ; m=tun ; M=drivers/net 2 c=MINIXFS ; m=minix ; M=fs/minix Enable one kernel module: $ make kernel-getconfig m=minixfs Getting kernel config: MINIXFS ... build/aarch64/linux-v5.1-virt/.config:CONFIGMINIXFS=m $ make kernel-setconfig m=minixfs Setting kernel config: m=minixfs ... build/aarch64/linux-v5.1-virt/.config:CONFIGMINIXFS=m Enable new kernel config: minixfs ... Build one kernel module e.g. minix.ko: $ make modules M=fs/minix/ Or $ make modules m=minix Install and clean the module: $ make modules-install M=fs/minix/ $ make modules-clean M=fs/minix/ More flexible usage: $ make kernel-setconfig m=tun $ make kernel tun.ko M=drivers/net $ make kernel drivers/net/tun.ko Build external kernel modules the same as internel modules: $ make modules m=hello Or $ make kernel x=$PWD/modules/hello/hello.ko 4.1.3 using kernel features 4.1.3.1 list supported kernel features Kernel features are abstracted in , including their configurations patchset, it can be used to manage both of the out-of-mainline and in-mainline features. $ make feature-list /labs/linux-lab/src/feature/linux : + 9pnet + core - debug - module + ftrace - v2.6.36 env.g3beige env.malta env.pc env.versatilepb - v2.6.37 env.g3beige + gcs - v2.6.36 env.g3beige env.malta env.pc env.versatilepb + kft - v2.6.36 env.malta env.pc + uksm - v2.6.38 Verified boards and Linux versions are recorded there, so, it should work without any issue if the environment not changed. 4.1.3.2 using kernel modules For example, to enable kernel modules support, simply do: // only upper case 'FEATURE' will be saved $ make feature FEATURE=module $ make kernel-olddefconfig $ make kernel 4.1.3.3 using rust feature Use as an example： $ make BOARD=x8664/pc switch to v6.1.1 Linux: $ make config LINUX=v6.1.1 Compile the kernel, and test it with one of the simplest module - : // clean up everything for a whole new test $ make kernel-cleanall // this 'f' variable will not be saved for standalone make targets $ make test f=rust m=rustminimal 4.1.3.4 using kft feature For feature in v2.6.36 for malta board: $ make cleanall b=malta $ make test b=malta f=kft LINUX=v2.6.36 4.1.3.5 using rt feature Linux officially provide RT Preemption support, but many patches are outside of mainline kernel, to use it: $ make feature-list f=rt $ make test b=i386/pc f=rt LINUX=v5.2 4.1.3.6 persist or clear feature setting Clear feature setting reset feature saved in .labconfig: $ make feature FEATURE=rust $ make feature FEATURE= The above function is the same as 'make config'. 4.1.4 Create new development branch If want to use a new development branch, please follow such steps: At first, Get into or another directory specified with , checkout a development branch from a specific version: $ cd src/linux-stable $ git checkout -b linux-v5.1-dev v5.1 And then, clone the necessary configurations and directories for our new branch. $ make kernel-clone LINUX=v5.1 LINUXNEW=linux-v5.1-dev The v5.1 must be the already supported version, if not, please use the near one in supported list, for example, board support such versions: $ make b=i386/pc list linux v2.6.10 v2.6.11.12 v2.6.12.6 v2.6.21.5 v2.6.24.7 v2.6.34.9 v2.6.35.14 v2.6.36 v4.6.7 v5.1 v5.2 If want to develop v2.6.38, please try to clone one from v2.6.36: $ cd src/linux-stable $ git checkout -b linux-v2.6.38-dev v2.6.38 $ make kernel-clone LINUX=v2.6.36 LINUXNEW=linux-v2.6.38-dev In development, please commit asap, and also, please use such commands carefully to avoid destroy your important changes: kernel-checkout, checkout a specified kernel version, may override your changes kernel-cleanup, clean up git repository, may remove your changes kernel-clean, clean building history kernel-cleanall, clean both of the building history and the source code changes 4.1.5 Use standalone git repository v0.8 starts to add , allows to configure the third party Linux source code repository, has added openEuler and wsl2, both of them support and the former support too. For example, to compile wsl2 kernel, switch to wsl2 directly: $ make BOARD=x8664/pc $ make config KERNELFORK=wsl2 $ make kernel To configure the wsl2 kernel version, configure it as following: $ make edit LINUXKERNELFORKwsl2 := linux-msft-wsl-5.10.74.3 The value should be one of the available tag in list. 4.2 Using U-Boot Bootloader Choose one of the tested boards: and . $ make BOARD=vexpress-a9 Download Uboot: $ make uboot-source Checkout the specified version: $ make uboot-checkout Patching with necessary changes, and available, use by default. $ make uboot-patch Use , or explicitly, should run before a new : $ make uboot-patch BOOTDEV=tftp $ make uboot-patch BOOTDEV=sdcard $ make uboot-patch BOOTDEV=flash is used to specify where to store and load the images for uboot, is used to tell kernel where to load the rootfs. Configure: $ make uboot-defconfig $ make uboot-menuconfig Building: $ make uboot Boot with and , use by default: $ make boot U=1 Use , or explicitly: $ make boot U=1 BOOTDEV=tftp $ make boot U=1 BOOTDEV=sdcard $ make boot U=1 BOOTDEV=flash We can also change during boot, for example: $ make boot U=1 BOOTDEV=flash ROOTDEV=nfs Clean images if want to update ramdisk, dtb and uImage: $ make uboot-images-clean $ make uboot-clean Save U-Boot images and configs: $ make uboot-save $ make uboot-saveconfig 4.3 Using QEMU Emulator Builtin QEMU may not work with the newest Linux kernel, so, we need compile and add external prebuilt qemu, this has been tested on vexpress-a9 and virt board. At first, build qemu-system-ARCH: $ make B=vexpress-a9 $ make qemu $ make qemu-save QEMU-ARCH-static and qemu-system-ARCH can not be compiled together. to build QEMU-ARCH-static, please enable in board specific Makefile and rebuild it. If QEMU and QTOOL specified, the one in bsp submodule will be used in advance of one installed in system, but the first used is the one just compiled if exists. While porting to newer kernel, Linux 5.0 hangs during boot on QEMU 2.5, after compiling a newer QEMU 2.12.0, no hang exists. please take notice of such issue in the future kernel upgrade. If already download QEMU and its submodules and don't want to upadte the submodules, just skip it: $ make qemu gitmodulestatus=0 4.4 Using Toolchains The pace of Linux mainline is very fast, builtin toolchains can not keep up, to reduce the maintaining pressure, external toolchain feature is added. for example, ARM64/virt, CCVER and CCPATH has been added for it. List available prebuilt toolchains: $ make gcc-list Download, decompress and enable the external toolchain: $ make gcc Switch compiler version if exists, for example: $ make gcc-switch CCORI=internal GCC=4.8 $ make gcc-switch CCORI=linaro If not external toolchain there, the builtin will be used back. If no builtin toolchain exists, please must use this external toolchain feature, currently, aarch64, arm, riscv, mipsel, ppc, i386, x8664 support such feature. GCC version can be configured in board specific Makefile for Linux, Uboot, Qemu and Root, for example: GCCLINUXv2.6.11.12 = 4.4 With this configuration, GCC will be switched automatically during defconfig and compiling of the specified Linux v2.6.11.12. To build host tools, host gcc should be configured tooplease specify explicitly: $ make gcc-list b=i386/pc $ make gcc-switch CCORI=internal GCC=4.8 b=i386/pc 4.5 Using Rootfs Builtin rootfs is minimal, is not enough for complex application development, which requires modern Linux distributions. Such a type of rootfs has been introduced and has been released as docker image, ubuntu 18.04 is added for arm32v7 at first, more later. Run it via docker directly: $ docker run -it tinylab/arm32v7-ubuntu Extract it out and run in Linux Lab: host$ sudo apt-get install -y qemu-user-static ARM32/vexpress-a9 user: root, password: root: host$ tools/root/docker/extract.sh tinylab/arm32v7-ubuntu arm lab $ make boot b=arm/vexpress-a9 U=0 V=1 MEM=1024M ROOTDEV=nfs ROOTFS=$PWD/prebuilt/fullroot/tmp/tinylab-arm32v7-ubuntu ARM64/raspi3 user: root, password: root: host$ tools/root/docker/extract.sh tinylab/arm64v8-ubuntu arm lab $ make boot b=aarch64/virt V=1 ROOTDEV=nfs ROOTFS=$PWD/prebuilt/fullroot/tmp/tinylab-arm64v8-ubuntu More rootfs from docker can be found: $ docker search arm64 | egrep "ubuntu|debian" arm64v8/ubuntu Ubuntu is a Debian-based Linux operating system 25 arm64v8/debian Debian is a Linux distribution that's composed 20 4.6 Debugging Linux and U-Boot 4.6.1 Debugging Linux Compile the kernel with debugging options: $ make feature FEATURE=debug $ make kernel-olddefconfig $ make kernel Compile with one thread: $ make kernel JOBS=1 And then debug it directly: $ make debug The above command will use tmux to split into two terminals, each running QEMU and gdb respectively, and load the script from .gdb/kernel.default. To switch tmux panes, use CTRL+b followed by the arrow key e.g., ←. To customize kernel gdbinit script, simply copy one and edit it manually: $ cp .gdb/kernel.default .gdb/kernel.user It equals to: $ make debug linux to automate debug testing: $ make test-debug linux find out the code line of a kernel panic address: $ make kernel-calltrace func+offset/length if the debug port has been used, please try to find out who used the port and kill it: $ sudo netstat -tlp | grep 1234 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:1234 0.0.0.0: LISTEN 3943/qemu-xxx $ sudo kill -9 3943 4.6.2 Debugging U-Boot To debug U-Boot with : $ make debug uboot The above command will use tmux to split into two terminals, each running QEMU and gdb respectively. To switch tmux panes, use CTRL+b followed by the arrow key e.g., ←. To automate U-Boot debug testing: $ make test-debug uboot The same to kernel gdbinit script, customize one for uboot: $ cp .gdb/uboot.default .gdb/uboot.user 4.7 Test Automation Use as the demo board here. $ make BOARD=virt Prepare for testing, install necessary files/scripts in : $ make rootdir $ make root-rebuild Simply boot and poweroff See poweroff hang: $ make test Don't poweroff after testing: $ make test TESTFINISH=echo Run guest test case: $ make test TESTCASE=/tools/ftrace/trace.sh Run guest test cases must be big enough, e.g. 4096, see feature below: $ make test TESTBEGIN=date TESTEND=date TESTCASE='ls /;echo hello world' Reboot the guest system for several times: $ make test TESTREBOOT=2 NOTE: reboot may 1 hang, 2 continue; 3 timeout killed, TESTTIMEOUT=30; 4 timeout continue, TIMEOUTCONTINUE=1 Test a feature of a specified Linux version on a specified board feature is for increase to 4096: $ make test f=kft LINUX=v2.6.36 b=malta TESTPREPARE=board-init,kernel-cleanup NOTE: and make sure test run automatically, but is not safe, please save your code before use it!! Test a kernel module: $ make test m=hello Test multiple kernel modules: $ make test m=exception,hello Test modules with specified ROOTDEV, nfs boot is used by default, but some boards may not support network: $ make test m=hello,exception TESTRD=ram0 Run test cases while testing kernel modules test cases run between insmod and rmmod: $ make test m=exception TESTBEGIN=date TESTEND=date TESTCASE='ls /root;echo hello world' TESTPREPARE=board-init,kernel-cleanup f=cmdlinesize Run test cases while testing internal kernel modules: $ make kernel-setconfig y=debugfs $ make test m=lkdtm TESTBEGIN='mount -t debugfs debugfs /mnt' TESTCASE='echo EXCEPTION > /mnt/provoke-crash/DIRECT' Run test cases while testing internal kernel modules, pass kernel arguments: $ make test m=lkdtm lkdtmargs='cpointname=DIRECT cpointtype=EXCEPTION' Run test without feature-init save time if not necessary: $ make test m=lkdtm lkdtmargs='cpointname=DIRECT cpointtype=EXCEPTION' TESTINIT=0 Or $ make raw-test m=lkdtm lkdtmargs='cpointname=DIRECT cpointtype=EXCEPTION' Run test with module and the module's necessary dependencies check with : $ make test m=lkdtm y=runtimetestingmenu,debugfs lkdtmargs='cpointname=DIRECT cpointtype=EXCEPTION' LINUX=v5.1 TESTPREPARE=kernel-cleanup Run test without feature-init, boot-init, boot-finish and no : $ make boot-test m=lkdtm lkdtmargs='cpointname=DIRECT cpointtype=EXCEPTION' Test a kernel module and make some targets before testing: $ make test m=exception TEST=kernel-checkout,kernel-patch,kernel-defconfig Test everything in one command from download to poweroff, see poweroff hang: $ make test TEST=kernel,root TESTPREPARE=board-init,kernel-cleanup,root-cleanup Test everything in one command with U-Boot while support, e.g. vexpress-a9: $ make test TEST=kernel,root,uboot TESTPREPARE=board-init,kernel-cleanup,root-cleanup,uboot-cleanup Test kernel hang during boot, allow to specify a timeout, timeout must happen while system hang: $ make test TESTTIMEOUT=30s Test kernel debug: $ make test DEBUG=1 Notes: The above tests may fail on some boards with some Linux versions, please upgrade the kernel versions if necessary. 4.8 File Sharing To transfer files between QEMU Board and Host, three methods are supported by default: 4.8.1 Install files to rootfs Simply put the files with a relative path in , install and rebuild the rootfs: $ mkdir src/system/root/ $ touch src/system/root/newfile $ make root-rebuild $ make boot 4.8.2 Share with NFS Boot the board with : $ make boot ROOTDEV=nfs Host: $ make env-dump VAR=ROOTDIR ROOTDIR="/labs/linux-lab/boards/<BOARD>/bsp/root/<BUILDROOTVERSION>/rootfs" 4.8.3 Transfer via tftp Using tftp server of host from the QEMU board with the command. Host: $ ifconfig br0 inet addr:172.17.0.3 Bcast:172.17.255.255 Mask:255.255.0.0 $ cd tftpboot/ $ ls tftpboot kft.patch kft.log QEMU Board: $ ls kftdata.log $ tftp -g -r kft.patch 172.17.0.3 $ tftp -p -r kft.log -l kftdata.log 172.17.0.3 Note: while put file from QEMU board to host, must create an empty file in host firstly. Buggy? 4.8.4 Share with 9p virtio To enable 9p virtio for a new board, please refer to qemu 9p setup034. qemu must be compiled with , and kernel must enable the necessary options. Reconfigure the kernel with: CONFIGNET9P=y CONFIGNET9PVIRTIO=y CONFIGNET9PDEBUG=y Optional CONFIG9PFS=y CONFIG9PFSPOSIXACL=y CONFIGPCI=y CONFIGVIRTIOPCI=y CONFIGPCIHOSTGENERIC=y only needed for the QEMU Arm 'virt' board If using or option for qemu, must enable the above PCI related options, otherwise will not work: 9pnetvirtio: no channels available for device hostshare mount: mounting hostshare on /hostshare failed: No such file or directory requires less kernel options. To enable the above options, please simply type: $ make feature FEATURE=9pnet $ make kernel-olddefconfig Docker host: $ modprobe 9pnetvirtio $ lsmod | grep 9p 9pnetvirtio 17519 0 9pnet 72068 1 9pnetvirtio Host: $ make BOARD=virt $ make root-rebuild $ touch hostshare/test Create a file in host $ make boot U=0 ROOTDEV=ram0 PBR=1 SHARE=1 $ make boot SHARE=1 SHAREDIR=src/modules for external modules development $ make boot SHARE=1 SHAREDIR=build/aarch64/linux-v5.1-virt/ for internal modules learning $ make boot SHARE=1 SHAREDIR=src/examples for c/assembly learning QEMU Board: $ ls /hostshare/ Access the file in guest test $ touch /hostshare/guest-test Create a file in guest Verified boards with Linux v5.1: | boards | Status | |-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------| | aarch64/virt | virtio-9p-device virtio-9p-pci breaks nfsroot | | arm/vexpress-a9 | only work with virtio-9p-device and without U-Boot booting | | arm/versatilepb | only work with virtio-9p-pci | | x8664/pc | only work with virtio-9p-pci | | i386/pc | only work with virtio-9p-pci | | riscv64/virt | work with virtio-9p-pci and virtio-9p-dev | | riscv32/virt | work with virtio-9p-pci and virtio-9p-dev | 4.9 Learning Assembly Linux Lab has added many assembly examples in : $ cd src/examples/assembly $ ls aarch64 arm mips64el mipsel powerpc powerpc64 riscv32 riscv64 x86 x8664 $ make -s -C aarch64/ Hello, ARM64! 4.10 Learning C 4.10.1 Host build and Run Use hello as example: $ cd src/examples/c/hello $ make gcc -fno-stack-protector -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-pie -no-pie -m32 -Wall -Werror -g -o hello hello.c Hello, World! 4.10.2 Cross build and Run Use X32 Code for x86-64, int/long/pointer to 32bits, ARM, MIPS, PPC and RISC-V as example: $ sudo apt-get update -y $ sudo apt-get install -y libc6-x32 libc6-dev-x32 libx32gcc-8-dev $ gcc -mx32 -o hello hello.c $ ./hello Hello, World! $ sudo apt-get install -y libc6-dev-armel-cross libc6-armel-cross $ arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -o hello hello.c $ qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/ ./hello Hello, World! $ sudo apt-get install -y libc6-dev-mipsel-cross libc6-mipsel-cross $ mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc -o hello hello.c $ qemu-mipsel -L /usr/mipsel-linux-gnu/ ./hello Hello, World! $ sudo apt-get install -y libc6-dev-powerpc-cross libc6-powerpc-cross // Must use -static for Linux Lab v0.6, otherwise, there will be segmentation fault $ powerpc-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o hello hello.c $ qemu-ppc -L /usr/powerpc-linux-gnu/ ./hello Hello, World! $ sudo apt-get install -y libc6-riscv64-cross libc6-dev-riscv64-cross $ riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -o hello hello.c $ qemu-riscv64 -L /usr/riscv64-linux-gnu/ ./hello Hello, World! Above run through , to run on target boards, please copy the binaries to target boards' rootfs with help from section 4.8.1. The main packages are , or , but x32 is an expection, it is libx32gcc. please list them via . 4.11 Running any make goals Linux Lab allows to access Makefile goals of the APPS easily, for example: $ make kernel help $ make kernel menuconfig $ make root help $ make root busybox-menuconfig $ make uboot help $ make uboot menuconfig Or $ make kernel-help $ make kernel-menuconfig $ make root-help $ make root-busybox-menuconfig $ make uboot-help $ make uboot-menuconfig Allows to run sub-make goals of kernel, root and U-Boot directly without entering into their own building directory. 4.12 Speed up kernel development 4.12.1 Speed up compiling and save disk life Notes：This operation may lose data, please take care! This feature aims to create a ram based temporary filesystem as the 'build' directory, to store the building data, If not backup them, they will be lost after shutting down the machine. Create temporary building cache: $ make build cache Check the status of building cache: $ make build status Use the cache for building speedup: $ time make kernel Backup the cache to a persistent file If the building file are important to you: $ make build backup Stop the building cache, revert back to use the build directory on the disk: $ make build uncache Use the backup as the build directory: $ sudo mount /path/to/backup-file /labs/linux-lab/build/ 4.12.2 ONESHOT Mode v0.9 adds a switch, it can be used to enable such functions: - Auto cache in memory - Auto cache in memory - Auto enable fast fetch, a.k.a git shallow fetch It is good for: - Disposable, destroy after using - If want, please save kernel and its config with and - Better for big-memory, small-disk and slow-CPU host machines - Both and are put in memory, not in disk - Good for instant kernel downloading and building - If target host has no Linux kernel source code, and the network is slow To use it, please simply run this before others: $ export ONESHOT=1 If want to make it persistent, just configure it in : ONESHOT := 1 4.12.3 Nolibc Mode v1.2-rc2 adds Nolibc mode, allows to build ultra small kernel and application, and package them together via initrd, to achieve "Kernel-only" deployments. Nolibc adds two types of files: - Small kernel config file: - Small nolibc application: Just similar to , before developing, just run this to enable mode: $ export NOLIBC=1 Or, write to to let it always work: NOLIBC := 1 To change the target nolibc aplication, we can configure , otherwise, the above hello.c will be used by default: $ make nolibc-clean $ make kernel NOLIBCSRC=$PWD/src/examples/nolibc/hello.c It is very good for pure kernel development. 4.12.4 Tiny Mode Based on Nolibc mode, v1.4-rc2 adds Tiny mode, allows to build ultra small kernel but with initrd boot support. Usage: $ export KCFG=linux.tiny.config $ make kernel $ make boot ROOTDEV=ram0 Compare to defconfig, it only enables minimal config options and makes sure initrd boot with an interactive shell, so, the compiling speed is x10 faster. It is very good for kernel features testing, development and research. 4.13 More Usage Read more: Why Why Using Linux Lab V1.0 In Chinese041 Why Using Linux Lab V2.0 In Chinese042 User Manual Linux Lab v1.4 User Manual056 Linux Lab v1.3 User Manual054 Linux Lab v1.2 User Manual053 Linux Lab v1.1 User Manual050 Linux Lab v1.0 User Manual033 Linux Lab v0.9 User Manual032 Linux Lab v0.8 User Manual031 Linux Lab Loongson Manual V0.2030 Linux Lab Videos CCTALK022 Bilibili025 Video Courses use Linux Lab as experiment environment The Perspective Linux ELF035 《Rust Language Quickstart》006 《Software Reverse Engineering Quickstart》037 《Linux Kernel Livepatch Introduction》038 The books or courses Linux Lab supported or plan to support books or courses list014 The boards Linux Lab supported or plan to support ARM IMX6ULL024 RISCV-64 D1 The hardwares developed by Linux Lab community Linux Lab Disk024, pre-installed Linux Lab disk Support Ubuntu 18.04-21.04, Deepin 20.2+, Fedora 34+, Mint 20.2+, Ezgo 14.04+, Kali, Manjaro Pocket Linux Disk024, pre-installed Linux distribution disk Support Ubuntu 18.04-21.04, Deepin 20.2+, Fedora 34+, Mint 20.2+, Ezgo 14.04+, Kali, Manjaro 5. Linux Lab Development This introduces how to add a new board for Linux Lab. 5.1 Choose a board supported by QEMU list the boards, use arm as an example: $ qemu-system-arm -M ? 5.2 Create the board directory Use as an example: $ mkdir boards/arm/vexpress-a9/ 5.3 Clone a Makefile from an existing board Use as an example: $ cp boards/arm/versatilebp/Makefile boards/arm/vexpress-a9/Makefile 5.4 Configure the variables from scratch Comment everything, add minimal ones and then others. Please refer to or the online one <https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/>. 5.5 At the same time, prepare the configs We need to prepare the configs for linux, buildroot and even uboot. Buildroot has provided many examples about buildroot and kernel configuration: buildroot: src/buildroot/configs/qemuARCHBOARDdefconfig kernel: src/buildroot/board/qemu/ARCH-BOARD/linux-VERSION.config U-Boot has also provided many default configs: uboot: src/u-boot/configs/vexpressca9x4defconfig Kernel itself also: kernel: src/linux-stable/arch/arm/configs/vexpressdefconfig Linux Lab itself also provide many working configs too, the target is a good helper to utilize existing configs: $ make list kernel v4.12 v5.0.10 v5.1 $ make kernel-clone LINUX=v5.1 LINUXNEW=v5.4 $ make kernel-menuconfig $ make kernel-saveconfig $ make list root 2016.05 2019.02.2 $ make root-clone BUILDROOT=2019.02.2 BUILDROOTNEW=2019.11 $ make root-menuconfig $ make root-saveconfig Edit the configs and Makefile until they match our requirements. $ make kernel-menuconfig $ make root-menuconfig $ make board-edit The configuration must be put in and named with necessary version info, use as an example: $ make kernel-saveconfig $ make root-saveconfig $ ls boards/aarch64/raspi3/bsp/configs/ buildroot2019.02.2defconfig linuxv5.1defconfig is the buildroot version, is the kernel version, both of these variables should be configured in . More usage about the commands: $ make qemu-clone QEMU=<oldversion> QEMUNEW=<newversion> $ make uboot-clone UBOOT=<oldversion> UBOOTNEW=<newversion> $ make kernel-clone LINUX=<oldversion> LINUXNEW=<newversion> $ make root-clone BUILDROOT=<oldversion> BUILDROOTNEW=<newversion> 5.6 Choose the versions of kernel, rootfs and U-Boot Please use instead of , use kernel as an example: $ cd src/linux-stable $ git tag ... v5.0 ... v5.1 .. v5.1.1 v5.1.5 ... If want v5.1 kernel, just put a line "LINUX = v5.1" in . Or clone a kernel config from the old one or the official defconfig: $ make kernel-clone LINUXNEW=v5.3 LINUX=v5.1 Or $ make B=i386/pc $ pushd Linux-stable && git checkout v5.4 && popd $ make kernel-clone LINUXNEW=v5.4 KCFG=i386defconfig If no tag existed, a virtual tag name with the real commmit number can be configured as following: LINUX = v2.6.11.12 LINUXLINUXv2.6.11.12 = 8e63197f Linux version specific ROOTFS are also supported: ROOTFSLINUXv2.6.12.6 ?= $BSPROOT/$BUILDROOT/rootfs32.cpio.gz 5.7 Configure, build and boot them Use kernel as an example: $ make kernel-defconfig $ make kernel-menuconfig $ make kernel $ make boot The same to Rootfs, U-Boot and even QEMU. 5.8 Save the images and configs $ make root-save $ make kernel-save $ make uboot-save $ make root-saveconfig $ make kernel-saveconfig $ make uboot-saveconfig 5.9 Upload everything At last, upload the images, defconfigs, patchset to board specific bsp submodule repository. Firstly, get the remote bsp repository address as following: $ git remote show origin remote origin Fetch URL: https://gitee.com/tinylab/qemu-aarch64-raspi3/ Push URL: https://gitee.com/tinylab/qemu-aarch64-raspi3/ HEAD branch: master Remote branch: master tracked Local branch configured for 'git pull': master merges with remote master Local ref configured for 'git push': master pushes to master local out of date Then, fork this repository from gitee.com, upload your changes, and send your pull request. 6. FAQs 6.1 Docker Issues 6.1.1 Speed up docker images downloading To optimize docker images download speed, please refer to section 6.1.6. 6.1.2 Docker network conflicts with LAN Cloud Lab use a default subnet, if this conflicts with another one, please change it like this: $ tools/docker/rm-all $ vim configs/linux-lab/docker/subnet $ cat configs/linux-lab/docker/subnet 172.23.0.0/16 $ tools/docker/run linux-lab If lab network still not work, please try another private network address and eventually to avoid conflicts with LAN address. 6.1.3 Why not allow running Linux Lab in local host The full function of Linux Lab depends on the full docker environment managed by Cloud Lab028, so, please really never try and therefore please don't complain about why there are lots of packages missing failures and even the other weird issues. Linux Lab is designed to use pre-installed environment with the docker technology and save our life by avoiding the packages installation issues in different systems, so, Linux Lab would never support local host using even in the future. 6.1.4 Run tools without sudo To use the tools under without sudo, please make sure add your account to the docker group and reboot your system to take effect: $ sudo usermod -aG docker <USER> $ newgrp docker If get error: "newgrp: group 'docker' does not exist", please add 'docker' group manually: $ sudo groupadd docker Notes: Currently, root user is not allowed to run Linux Lab。 6.1.5 Network not work If ping not work, please check one by one: DNS issue if work, please check and make sure it is the same as your host configuration. IP issue if ping not work, please refer to network conflict issue and change the ip range of docker containers. 6.1.6 Client.Timeout exceeded while waiting headers This means must configure one of the following docker mirror sites: Aliyun Docker Mirror Documentation018 USTC Docker Mirror Documentation020 Potential methods of configuration in Ubuntu, depends on docker and Ubuntu versions: : echo "DOCKEROPTS=\"\$DOCKEROPTS --registry-mirror=<your accelerate address>\"" : ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --registry-mirror=<your accelerate address> : "registry-mirrors": "<your accelerate address>" Please restart docker service after change the accelerate address: $ sudo service docker restart For the other Linux systems, Windows and macOS System, please refer to Aliyun Mirror Speedup Document018. IF still slow, please check if the mirror site is configured normally and without typos: $ docker info | grep -A1 -i Mirrors Registry Mirrors: https://XXXXX.mirror.aliyuncs.com/ 6.1.7 Restart Linux Lab after host system shutdown or reboot If want to restore the installed softwares and related configurations, please save the container manually: $ tools/docker/save linux-lab After host system include virtual machine shutdown or reboot, you can restart the lab via the "Linux Lab" icon on the desktop, or just like before, issue this command: $ tools/docker/run linux-lab Current implementation doesn't support the direct 'docker start' command, please learn it. If the above methods still not restart the lab, please refer to the methods mentioned in the 6.3.9 section. If resume from a suspended host system, the lab will restore automatically, no need to do anything to restart it, just use one of the 4 login methods mentioned in the 2.4 section, for example, start a web browser to connect it: $ tools/docker/webvnc 6.1.8 the following directives are specified both as a flag and in the configuration file If getting such error: unable to configure the Docker daemon with file /etc/docker/daemon.json: the following directives are specified both as a flag and in the configuration file: registry-mirrors: from flag: https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/, from file: https://xxx.mirror.aliyuncs.com Means both and configured , please comment the late one and restart docker: $ sudo service docker restart 6.1.9 pathspec FETCHHEAD did not match any file known to git If get such error while running , it means network issue, please refer to section 6.1.5。 Could not resolve host: gitee.com error: pathspec 'FETCHHEAD' dit not match any files known to git 6.1.10 Docker not work in Ubuntu 20.04 If docker not work in Ubuntu 20.04, please use and clean up the arguments of dockerd, learn more from docker daemon008: $ sudo cat /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/docker.conf Service ExecStart= ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd $ sudo cp /etc/docker/daemon.json /etc/docker/daemon.json.bak $ sudo cp doc/install/daemon.json /etc/docker/ $ sudo service docker restart Please make sure using the best for better download speed. 6.1.11 Error creating aufs mount If not work with failure like "error creating aufs mount to ... invalid arguments", that means the storage driver used by docker is not supported by current system, please choose another one from this page009, and configure it in , for example: $ sudo vim /etc/docker/daemon.json "registry-mirrors": "https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn", "storage-driver": "devicemapper" This issue is related to kernel version, the same system may upgrade kernel version and therefore support different storage driver. 6.2 QEMU Issues 6.2.1 Why kvm speedding up is disabled kvm only supports both of and currently, and it also requires the CPU and bios support, otherwise, you may get this error log: modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'kvmintel': Operation not supported Check CPU virtualization support, if nothing output, then, cpu not support virtualization: $ cat /proc/cpuinfo | egrep --color=always "vmx|svm" If CPU supports, we also need to make sure it is enabled in bios features, simply reboot your computer, press 'Delete' to enter bios, please make sure the 'Intel virtualization technology' feature is 'enabled'. 6.2.2 Poweroff hang Both of the and commands not work on these boards currently LINUX=v5.1: mipsel/malta exclude LINUX=v2.6.36 mipsel/ls232 mipsel/ls1b mips64el/ls2k mips64el/ls3a7a aarch64/raspi3 arm/versatilepb System will directly hang there while running or , to exit qemu, please pressing or using .

The first one is setting noVNC before connecting. Press the left sidebar of noVNC web page Disconnect Enable 'Auto Scaling Mode' via 'Settings -> Scaling Mode: -> Local Scaling -> Apply' Connect The second one is setting while running Linux Lab. The screen size of lab is captured by xrandr, if not work, please check and set your own, for example: Get available screen size values: $ xrandr --current Screen 0: minimum 1 x 1, current 1916 x 891, maximum 16384 x 16384 Virtual1 connected primary 1916x891+0+0 normal left inverted right x axis y axis 0mm x 0mm 1916x891 60.00+ 2560x1600 59.99 1920x1440 60.00 1856x1392 60.00 1792x1344 60.00 1920x1200 59.88 1600x1200 60.00 1680x1050 59.95 1400x1050 59.98 1280x1024 60.02 1440x900 59.89 1280x960 60.00 1360x768 60.02 1280x800 59.81 1152x864 75.00 1280x768 59.87 1024x768 60.00 800x600 60.32 640x480 59.94 Update remote screen size: $ cd /path/to/cloud-lab $ tools/docker/resize 1280x1024 Specifiy anyone above $ tools/docker/resize If no argument, Sync with host system If want fullscreen, follow these steps: 1. If using virtual machine, fullscreen virtual machine at fist 2. Run to resize remote lab screen size 3. Enter into WebVNC Interface, Click the FullScreen button at the left sidebar 6.3.6 How to work in fullscreen mode Open the left sidebar, press the 'Fullscreen' button. 6.3.7 How to record video Enable recording Open the left sidebar, press the 'Settings' button, config 'File/Title/Author/Category/Tags/Description' and enable the 'Record Screen' option. Start recording Press the 'Connect' button. Stop recording Press the 'Disconnect' button. Replay recorded video Press the 'Play' button. Share it Videos are stored in 'cloud-lab/recordings', share it with help from showdesk.io019. 6.3.8 Linux Lab not response The VNC connection may hang for some unknown reasons and therefore Linux Lab may not response sometimes, to restore it, please press the flush button of web browser or re-connect after explicitly disconnect. 6.3.9 VNC login with failures If VNC login return "Disconnect timeout", wait a while and press the left 'Connect' button again, otherwise, check as following: At first, check the containers' status Up: Ok, Exit: Bad: $ docker ps -a CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 19a61ba075b5 tinylab/linux-lab "/tools/lab/run" 4 days ago Up 4 days 22/tcp, 5900/tcp linux-lab-21575 75dae89984c9 tinylab/cloud-ubuntu-web "/startup.sh" 8 days ago Up 8 days ....443/tcp cloud-ubuntu-web If the status is 'Exit', that means container may be shutdown or may never up, run it again to resume for the shutdown case: $ tools/docker/run linux-lab Otherwise, check the running logs: $ tools/docker/logs linux-lab If normal, that means the login account and password may have been invalid for some exceptions, please regenerte new account and password with the coming steps: Note: The command will remove some containers and data, please do necessary backup before run it, for example, save the container: $ tools/docker/save linux-lab VNC login fails while using mismatched password, to fix up such issue, please clean up all and rerun it: $ tools/docker/clean linux-lab $ tools/docker/rerun linux-lab If the above command not work, please try this one It will clean more data, please do necessary backup $ tools/docker/clean-all $ tools/docker/rerun linux-lab 6.3.10 Ubuntu Snap Issues Users report many snap issues, please use apt-get instead: users can not be added to docker group and break non-root operation. snap service exhausts the /dev/loop devices and break mount operation. 6.3.11 How to exit fullscreen mode of vnc clients The easiest method is kill the VNC server in Linux Lab: $ sudo pkill x11vnc 6.4 Lab Issues 6.4.1 No working init found This means the rootfs.ext2 image may be broken, please remove it and try again, for example: $ rm boards/aarch64/raspi3/bsp/root/2019.02.2/rootfs.ext2 $ make boot command can create this image automatically. 6.4.2 linux/compiler-gcc7.h: No such file or directory This means using a newer gcc than the one Linux kernel version supported, the solution is switching to an older gcc version via , use board as an example: $ make gcc-list $ make gcc-switch CCORI=internal GCC=4.4 6.4.3 linux-lab/configs: Permission denied This may happen at while the repository is cloned with user, please simply update the owner of directory: $ cd /path/to/cloud-lab $ sudo chown <USER>:<USER> -R ./ $ tools/docker/rerun linux-lab Notes: To make a consistent working environment, Linux Lab only support using as general user: 'ubuntu'. 6.4.4 scripts/Makefile.headersinst: Missing UAPI file This means MAC OSX not use Case sensitive filesystem, create one using or yourself: $ hdiutil create -type SPARSE -size 60g -fs "Case-sensitive Journaled HFS+" -volname labspace labspace.dmg $ hdiutil attach -mountpoint ~/Develop/labspace -nobrowse labspace.dmg.sparseimage $ cd ~/Develop/labspace 6.4.5 unable to create file: net/netfilter/xtdscp.c This means Windows not enable filesystem's case sensitive feature, just enable it: $ cd /path/to/cloud-lab $ fsutil file SetCaseSensitiveInfo ./ enable 6.4.6 how to run as root By default, no password required to run as root with: $ sudo -s Notes: Please don't use the 'su' command. 6.4.7 not in supported list Such information means the specified value is not supported currently: $ make boot ROOTDEV=vda ERR: /dev/vda not in supported ROOTDEV list: /dev/sda /dev/ram0 /dev/nfs, update may help: 'make bsp B=mips64el/ls3a7a'. Stop. $ make boot LINUX=v5.8 Makefile:594: ERR: v5.8 not in supported Linux list: loongnix-release-1903 v5.7, clone one please: 'make kernel-clone KERNELNEW=v5.8'. Stop. $ make boot QEMU=loongson-v1.1 Makefile:606: ERR: loongson-v1.1 not in supported QEMU list: loongson-v1.0, clone one please: 'make qemu-clone QEMUNEW=loongson-v1.1'. There are two main types: One is the specified version is not there or has not been verified Please clone one and verify it with the usage of from section 5. Another is the specified value is invalid or simply not verified For example, the above vda is not added in the This board may not support such type of device or just nobody verify and add it This differs from board and kernel version 6.4.8 is not a valid rootfs directory If using prebuilt filesystem, this error means the rootfs dir, ramdisk or harddisk creating procedure has been interrupted by or similar operations and it means the filesystem is not complete. If no important changes in BSP repository, reset it may help: $ make bsp-cleanup If using external filesystem, please make sure the filesystem architecture follows the Linux standards. 7.
