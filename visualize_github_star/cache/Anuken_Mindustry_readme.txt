This will create an unsigned APK in . To debug the application on a connected device/emulator, run . Troubleshooting Permission Denied If the terminal returns or on Mac/Linux, run before running . This is a one-time procedure. Where is the package? As the name implies, is generated at build time based on other code. You will not find source code for this package in the repository, and it should not be edited by hand. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the "source" of generated code in : - , classes: Generated from methods marked with . - All entity classes , , , etc: Generated from component classes in the package, and combined using definitions in . - , , , , etc: Generated based on files in the respective asset folders. --- Gradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. <br> After building, the output .JAR file should be in for desktop builds, and in for server builds. Feature Requests Post feature requests and feedback here.
