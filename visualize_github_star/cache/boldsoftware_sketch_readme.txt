It draws the ü¶â </div> üöÄ Overview Sketch runs in your terminal, has a web UI, understands your code, and helps you get work done. To keep your environment pristine, sketch starts a docker container and outputs its work onto a branch in your host git repository. Sketch helps with most programming environments, but Sketch has extra goodies for Go. <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sketch-assets/screenshot.jpg" alt="Sketch Screenshot" width="800"/> üìã Quick Start Install via Homebrew Update to the latest version by running . Install via GitHub Releases Grab the most recent nightly release. Update by running . Build from source Clone this repo, and then run: üîß Requirements Currently, Sketch runs on MacOS and Linux. It uses Docker for containers. | Platform | Installation | | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | MacOS | or OrbStack or Docker Desktop | | Linux | or equivalent for your distro | | WSL2 | Install Docker Desktop for Windows docker entirely inside WSL2 is tricky | The sketch.dev service is used to provide access to an LLM service and give you a way to access the web UI from anywhere. ü§ù Community & Feedback - Discord: Join our community at https://discord.gg/6w9qNRUDzS - GitHub Issues: Submit feedback at https://github.com/boldsoftware/sketch/issues üìñ User Guide Getting Started Start Sketch by running in a Git repository. It will open your browser to the Sketch chat interface, but you can also use the CLI interface. Use if you want to use just the CLI interface. Ask Sketch about your codebase or ask it to implement a feature. It may take a little while for Sketch to do its work, so hit the bell üîî icon to enable browser notifications. We won't spam you or anything; it will notify you when the Sketch agent's turn is done, and there's something to look at. How Sketch Works <!-- TODO: innie/outtie picture --> When you start Sketch, it: 1. Creates a Dockerfile 2. Builds it 3. Copies your repository into it 4. Starts a Docker container with the "inside" Sketch running This design lets you run multiple sketches in parallel since they each have their own sandbox. It also lets Sketch work without worry: it can trash its own container, but it can't trash your machine. Sketch's agentic loop uses tool calls mostly shell commands, but also a handful of other important tools to allow the LLM to interact with your codebase. Getting Your Git Changes Out <!-- TODO: git picture --> Sketch is trained to make Git commits. When those happen, they are automatically pushed to the git repository where you started sketch with branch names . Finding Sketch branches: The UI keeps track of the latest branch it pushed and displays it prominently. You can use standard Git workflows to pull those branches into your workspace: or merge the branch or reset to the branch Ie use the same workflows you would if you were pulling in a friend's Pull Request. Advanced: You can ask Sketch to and rebase onto another commit. This will also fetch where you started Sketch, and we do a bit of "git fetch refspec configuration" to make work as a git reference. Don't be afraid of asking Sketch to help you rebase, merge/squash commits, rewrite commit messages, and so forth; it's good at it! Reviewing Diffs The diff view shows you changes since Sketch started. Leaving comments on lines adds them to the chat box, and, when you hit Send at the bottom of the page, Sketch goes to work addressing your comments. Connecting to Sketch's Container You can interact directly with the container in three ways: 1. Web UI Terminal: Use the "Terminal" tab in the UI 2. SSH: Look at the startup logs or click the information icon to see a command like . We have automatically configured your SSH configuration to make these special hostnames work. 3. Visual Studio Code: Look for a command line or magic link behind the information icon, or when Sketch starts up. This starts a new VSCode session "remoted into" the container. You can edit the code, use the terminal, review diffs, and so forth. Using SSH and/or VSCode allows you to forward ports from the container to your machine. For example, if you want to start your development webserver, you can do something like this: This makes on your machine point to inside the container. Using Browser Tools You can ask Sketch to browse a web page and take screenshots. There are tools both for taking screenshots and "reading images", the latter of which sends the image to the LLM. This functionality is handy if you're working on a web page and want to see what the in-progress change looks like. ‚ùì FAQ "No space left on device" Docker images, containers, and so forth tend to pile up. Ask Docker to prune unused images and containers: üõ†Ô∏è Development !Go Referencehttps://pkg.go.dev/sketch.dev See CONTRIBUTING.md for development guidelines. üìÑ Open Source Sketch is open source. It is right here in this repository! Have a look around and mod away. If you want to run Sketch entirely without the sketch.dev service, you can set the flag and then provide an environment variable. More LLM services coming soon!
