Other Models Besides Vicuna, we also released two additional models: LongChat and FastChat-T5. You can use the commands below to chat with them. They will automatically download the weights from Hugging Face repos. | Model | Chat Command | Hugging Face Repo | | --- | --- | --- | | LongChat-7B | | lmsys/longchat-7b-32k | | FastChat-T5-3B | | lmsys/fastchat-t5-3b-v1.0 | Inference with Command Line Interface <a href="https://lmarena.ai"><img src="assets/screenshotcli.png" width="70%"></a> Experimental Feature: You can specify to enable rich text output and better text streaming quality for some non-ASCII content. This may not work properly on certain terminals. Supported Models FastChat supports a wide range of models, including LLama 2, Vicuna, Alpaca, Baize, ChatGLM, Dolly, Falcon, FastChat-T5, GPT4ALL, Guanaco, MTP, OpenAssistant, OpenChat, RedPajama, StableLM, WizardLM, xDAN-AI and more. See a complete list of supported models and instructions to add a new model here. Single GPU The command below requires around 14GB of GPU memory for Vicuna-7B and 28GB of GPU memory for Vicuna-13B. See the "Not Enough Memory" section below if you do not have enough memory. can be a local folder or a Hugging Face repo name. Multiple GPUs You can use model parallelism to aggregate GPU memory from multiple GPUs on the same machine. Tips: Sometimes the "auto" device mapping strategy in huggingface/transformers does not perfectly balance the memory allocation across multiple GPUs. You can use to specify the maximum memory per GPU for storing model weights. This allows it to allocate more memory for activations, so you can use longer context lengths or larger batch sizes. For example, CPU Only This runs on the CPU only and does not require GPU. It requires around 30GB of CPU memory for Vicuna-7B and around 60GB of CPU memory for Vicuna-13B. Use Intel AI Accelerator AVX512BF16/AMX to accelerate CPU inference. Metal Backend Mac Computers with Apple Silicon or AMD GPUs Use to enable GPU acceleration on Mac computers requires torch >= 2.0. Use to turn on 8-bit compression. Vicuna-7B can run on a 32GB M1 Macbook with 1 - 2 words / second. Intel XPU Intel Data Center and Arc A-Series GPUs Install the Intel Extension for PyTorch. Set the OneAPI environment variables: Use to enable XPU/GPU acceleration. Vicuna-7B can run on an Intel Arc A770 16GB. Ascend NPU Install the Ascend PyTorch Adapter. Set the CANN environment variables: Use to enable NPU acceleration. Vicuna-7B/13B can run on an Ascend NPU. Not Enough Memory If you do not have enough memory, you can enable 8-bit compression by adding to commands above. This can reduce memory usage by around half with slightly degraded model quality. It is compatible with the CPU, GPU, and Metal backend. Vicuna-13B with 8-bit compression can run on a single GPU with 16 GB of VRAM, like an Nvidia RTX 3090, RTX 4080, T4, V100 16GB, or an AMD RX 6800 XT. In addition to that, you can add to commands above to offload weights that don't fit on your GPU onto the CPU memory. This requires 8-bit compression to be enabled and the bitsandbytes package to be installed, which is only available on linux operating systems. More Platforms and Quantization - For AMD GPU users, please install ROCm and the ROCm version of PyTorch before you install FastChat. See also this post. - FastChat supports ExLlama V2.

Use models from modelscope For Chinese users, you can use models from www.modelscope.cn via specify the following environment variables. Serving with Web GUI <a href="https://lmarena.ai"><img src="assets/screenshotgui.png" width="70%"></a> To serve using the web UI, you need three main components: web servers that interface with users, model workers that host one or more models, and a controller to coordinate the webserver and model workers. You can learn more about the architecture here. Here are the commands to follow in your terminal: Launch the controller This controller manages the distributed workers. Launch the model workers Wait until the process finishes loading the model and you see "Uvicorn running on ...". The model worker will register itself to the controller . To ensure that your model worker is connected to your controller properly, send a test message using the following command: You will see a short output. Launch the Gradio web server This is the user interface that users will interact with. By following these steps, you will be able to serve your models using the web UI. You can open your browser and chat with a model now. If the models do not show up, try to reboot the gradio web server. Launch Chatbot Arena side-by-side battle UI Currently, Chatbot Arena is powered by FastChat. Here is how you can launch an instance of Chatbot Arena locally. FastChat supports popular API-based models such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral and more. To add a custom API, please refer to the model support doc. Below we take OpenAI models as an example. Create a JSON configuration file with the api endpoints of the models you want to serve, for example: For Anthropic models, specify with your Anthropic key. Similarly, for gemini model, specify . More details can be found in apiprovider.py. To serve your own model using local gpus, follow the instructions in Serving with Web GUI. Now you're ready to launch the server: Optional: Advanced Features, Scalability, Third Party UI - You can register multiple model workers to a single controller, which can be used for serving a single model with higher throughput or serving multiple models at the same time. When doing so, please allocate different GPUs and ports for different model workers. - You can also launch a multi-tab gradio server, which includes the Chatbot Arena tabs. - The default model worker based on huggingface/transformers has great compatibility but can be slow. If you want high-throughput batched serving, you can try vLLM integration. - If you want to host it on your own UI or third party UI, see Third Party UI. API OpenAI-Compatible RESTful APIs & SDK FastChat provides OpenAI-compatible APIs for its supported models, so you can use FastChat as a local drop-in replacement for OpenAI APIs. The FastChat server is compatible with both openai-python library and cURL commands. The REST API is capable of being executed from Google Colab free tier, as demonstrated in the FastChatAPIGoogleColab.ipynb notebook, available in our repository. See docs/openaiapi.md. Hugging Face Generation APIs See fastchat/serve/huggingfaceapi.py. LangChain Integration See docs/langchainintegration. Evaluation We use MT-bench, a set of challenging multi-turn open-ended questions to evaluate models. To automate the evaluation process, we prompt strong LLMs like GPT-4 to act as judges and assess the quality of the models' responses. See instructions for running MT-bench at fastchat/llmjudge. MT-bench is the new recommended way to benchmark your models. If you are still looking for the old 80 questions used in the vicuna blog post, please go to vicuna-blog-eval. Fine-tuning Data Vicuna is created by fine-tuning a Llama base model using approximately 125K user-shared conversations gathered from ShareGPT.com with public APIs. To ensure data quality, we convert the HTML back to markdown and filter out some inappropriate or low-quality samples. Additionally, we divide lengthy conversations into smaller segments that fit the model's maximum context length. For detailed instructions to clean the ShareGPT data, check out here. We will not release the ShareGPT dataset. If you would like to try the fine-tuning code, you can run it with some dummy conversations in dummyconversation.json. You can follow the same format and plug in your own data. Code and Hyperparameters Our code is based on Stanford Alpaca with additional support for multi-turn conversations. We use similar hyperparameters as the Stanford Alpaca. | Hyperparameter | Global Batch Size | Learning rate | Epochs | Max length | Weight decay | | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | | Vicuna-13B | 128 | 2e-5 | 3 | 2048 | 0 | Fine-tuning Vicuna-7B with Local GPUs - Install dependency - You can use the following command to train Vicuna-7B with 4 x A100 40GB. Update with the actual path to Llama weights and with the actual path to data. Tips: - If you are using V100 which is not supported by FlashAttention, you can use the memory-efficient attention implemented in xFormers. Install xformers and replace above with fastchat/train/trainxformers.py. - If you meet out-of-memory due to "FSDP Warning: When using FSDP, it is efficient and recommended... ", see solutions here. - If you meet out-of-memory during model saving, see solutions here. - To turn on logging to popular experiment tracking tools such as Tensorboard, MLFlow or Weights & Biases, use the argument, e.g. pass to turn on logging to Weights & Biases. Other models, platforms and LoRA support More instructions to train other models e.g., FastChat-T5 and use LoRA are in docs/training.md. Fine-tuning on Any Cloud with SkyPilot SkyPilot is a framework built by UC Berkeley for easily and cost effectively running ML workloads on any cloud AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda, etc..
