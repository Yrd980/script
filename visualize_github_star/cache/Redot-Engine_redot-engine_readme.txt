Redot Engine <p align="center"> <a href="https://redotengine.org/"> <img src="logooutlined.png" width="400" alt="Redot Engine logo"> </a> </p> 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine Redot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so that users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms Linux, macOS, Windows, mobile platforms Android, iOS, as well as Web-based platforms and consoles. Free, open source and community-driven Redot is a completely free and open source fork of Godot under the very permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down to the last line of engine code. Redot's development is fully independent and truly community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their expectations. Before being open sourced in February 2014, Godot had been developed by Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur both still maintaining Godot for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles. Redot was forked from Godot in September 2024, intending to improve upon Godot in order to fulfill its potential and contribute to the shared codebase of both through a more genuinely community-driven model than Godot.

ReX Engine Looking to try out new features that aren't backwards compatible with Godot, or would you like to create new features for Redot Engine that can't be added here due to compatibility issues? Meet us over at the ReX Engine Repo Where we aim to create a modern engine using Redot Engine as a starting point, free from godots choices and shortcomings, and innovate in ways not currently possible here within Redot Engine.
