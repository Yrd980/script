swappy A Wayland native snapshot and editor tool, inspired by Snappy on macOS. Works great with grim, slurp and sway. But can easily work with other screen copy tools that can output a final image to . See below. Screenshot !Swappy Screenshot Example usage Output of or any tool outputting an image file: Swappshot a PNG file: Print final surface to stdout useful to pipe with other tools: Grab a swappshot from a specific window under Sway, using and : Config The config file is located at or at . The file follows the GLib format. See the page for details. There is example config file here. The following lines can be used as swappy's default: - is where swappshots will be saved, can contain env variables, when it does not exist, swappy attempts to create it first, but does not abort if directory creation fails - : is the filename template, if it contains a date format, this will be parsed into a timestamp. Format is detailed in strftime3. If this date format is missing, filename will have no timestamp - is used to toggle the paint panel on or off upon startup - is the default line size must be between 1 and 50 - is the default text size must be between 10 and 50 - is the font used to render text, its format is pango friendly - is the mode activated at application start must be one of: brush|text|rectangle|ellipse|arrow|blur, matching is case-insensitive - is used to make the application exit after saving the picture or copying it to the clipboard - is used to toggle shape filling for the rectangle and ellipsis tools on or off upon startup - is used to toggle auto saving of final buffer to upon exit - is used to set a default value for the custom color Keyboard Shortcuts - : Toggle Paint Panel <hr> - : Switch to Brush - : Switch to Text - : Switch to Rectangle - : Switch to Ellipse - : Switch to Arrow - : Switch to Blur stands for droplet <hr> - : Use Red Color - : Use Green Color - : Use Blue Color - : Use Custom Color - : Reduce Stroke Size - : Increase Stroke Size - : Reset Stroke Size - : Toggle Shape Filling - : Clear Paints cannot be undone <hr> - : Center Shape Rectangle & Ellipse based on draw start <hr> - : Undo - or : Redo - : Save to file see man page - : Copy to clipboard - or or : Quit swappy Limitations - Copy: If you don't have wl-clipboard installed, copy to clipboard won't work if you close swappy the content of the clipboard is lost. This because GTK 3.24 has not implemented persistent storage on wayland backend yet. We need to do it on the Wayland level, or wait for GTK 4. For now, we use if installed and revert to clipboard if not found. - Fonts: Swappy relies on Font Awesome 5 being present to properly render the icons. On Arch you can simply install those with: Installation - Arch Linux - Arch Linux git - Fedora - Gentoo - openSUSE - Void Linux Building from source Install dependencies on Arch, name can vary for other distros: - meson - ninja - cairo - pango - gtk - glib2 - scdoc Optional dependencies: - to make sure the copy is saved if you close swappy - to draw the paint icons properly Then run: i18n This section is for developers, maintainers and translators. To add support to a new locale or when translations are updated: 1. Update when new locales are added 2. Generate a new file ignore and do not commit potential noise in other files: To rebuild the base template should happen less often: See the meson documentation for details.
