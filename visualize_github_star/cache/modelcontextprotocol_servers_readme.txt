Model Context Protocol servers This repository is a collection of reference implementations for the Model Context Protocol MCP, as well as references to community built servers and additional resources. The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models LLMs secure, controlled access to tools and data sources. Typically, each MCP server is implemented with an MCP SDK: - C MCP SDK - Go MCP SDK - Java MCP SDK - Kotlin MCP SDK - Python MCP SDK - Ruby MCP SDK - Rust MCP SDK - Swift MCP SDK - TypeScript MCP SDK > Note: Lists in this README are maintained in alphabetical order to minimize merge conflicts when adding new items. üåü Reference Servers These servers aim to demonstrate MCP features and the official SDKs. - Everything - Reference / test server with prompts, resources, and tools - Fetch - Web content fetching and conversion for efficient LLM usage - Filesystem - Secure file operations with configurable access controls - Git - Tools to read, search, and manipulate Git repositories - Memory - Knowledge graph-based persistent memory system - Sequential Thinking - Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thought sequences - Time - Time and timezone conversion capabilities Archived The following reference servers are now archived and can be found at servers-archived. - AWS KB Retrieval - Retrieval from AWS Knowledge Base using Bedrock Agent Runtime - Brave Search - Web and local search using Brave's Search API.
