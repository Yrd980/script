FLUX by Black Forest Labs: https://bfl.ai. Documentation for our API can be found here: docs.bfl.ai. !grid This repo contains minimal inference code to run image generation & editing with our Flux open-weight models. Local installation Local installation with TensorRT support If you would like to install the repository with TensorRT support, you currently need to install a PyTorch image from NVIDIA instead. First install enroot, next follow the steps below: Open-weight models We are offering an extensive suite of open-weight models. For more information about the individual models, please refer to the link under Usage. | Name | Usage | HuggingFace repo | License | | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | Text to Image | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell | apache-2.0 | | | Text to Image | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev | FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License | | | In/Out-painting | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev | FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License | | | Structural Conditioning | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Canny-dev | FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License | | | Structural Conditioning | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Depth-dev | FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License | | | Structural Conditioning | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Canny-dev-lora | FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License | | | Structural Conditioning | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Depth-dev-lora | FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License | | | Image variation | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Redux-dev | FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License | | | Image editing | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Kontext-dev | FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License | | | Text to Image | https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Krea-dev | FLUX.1-dev Non-Commercial License | The weights of the autoencoder are also released under apache-2.0 and can be found in the HuggingFace repos above. API usage Our API offers access to all models including our Pro tier non-open weight models. Check out our API documentation docs.bfl.ai to learn more. Licensing models for commercial use You can license our models for commercial use here: https://bfl.ai/pricing/licensing As the fee is based on a monthly usage, we provide code to automatically track your usage via the BFL API. To enable usage tracking please select trackusage in the cli or click the corresponding checkmark in our provided demos. Example: Using FLUX.1 Kontext with usage tracking We provide a reference implementation for running FLUX.1 with usage tracking enabled for commercial licensing. This can be customized as needed as long as the usage reporting is accurate. For the reporting logic to work you will need to set your API key as an environment variable before running: You can call like this with tracking activated: For a single generation: The above reporting logic works similarly for FLUX.1 dev and FLUX.1 Tools dev. Note that this is only required when using one or more of our open weights models commercially. More information on the commercial licensing can be found at the BFL Helpdesk.
