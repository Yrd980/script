Easily monitor conversion, web vitals, and revenue. - Session replays: Watch real user sessions of interactions with your website or mobile app to diagnose issues and understand user behavior. - Feature flags: Safely roll out features to select users or cohorts with feature flags. - Experiments: Test changes and measure their statistical impact on goal metrics. Set up experiments with no-code too. - Error tracking: Track errors, get alerts, and resolve issues to improve your product. - Surveys: Ask anything with our collection of no-code survey templates, or build custom surveys with our survey builder. - Data warehouse: Sync data from external tools like Stripe, Hubspot, your data warehouse, and more. Query it alongside your product data. - Data pipelines: Run custom filters and transformations on your incoming data. Send it to 25+ tools or any webhook in real time or batch export large amounts to your warehouse. - LLM observability: Capture traces, generations, latency, and cost for your LLM-powered app. Best of all, all of this is free to use with a generous monthly free tier for each product.

Getting started with PostHog PostHog Cloud Recommended The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is signing up for free to PostHog Cloud or PostHog Cloud EU. Your first 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses are free every month, after which you pay based on usage. Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy Advanced If you want to self-host PostHog, you can deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker recommended 4GB memory: Open source deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month, after which we recommend migrating to a PostHog Cloud. We do not provide customer support or offer guarantees for open source deployments. See our self-hosting docs, troubleshooting guide, and disclaimer for more info.
