The original Trilium project is in maintenance mode. Migrating from Trilium? There are no special migration steps to migrate from a zadam/Trilium instance to a TriliumNext/Notes instance. Simply install TriliumNext/Notes as usual and it will use your existing database. Versions up to and including v0.90.4 are compatible with the latest zadam/trilium version of v0.63.7. Any later versions of TriliumNext have their sync versions incremented. üìñ Documentation We're currently in the progress of moving the documentation to in-app hit the key within Trilium. As a result, there may be some missing parts until we've completed the migration. If you'd prefer to navigate through the documentation within GitHub, you can navigate the User Guide documentation. Below are some quick links for your convenience to navigate the documentation: - Server installation - Docker installation - Upgrading TriliumNext - Concepts and Features - Note - Patterns of personal knowledge base Until we finish reorganizing the documentation, you may also want to browse the old documentation. üí¨ Discuss with us Feel free to join our official conversations. We would love to hear what features, suggestions, or issues you may have! - Matrix For synchronous discussions. - The Matrix room is also bridged to XMPP - Github Discussions For asynchronous discussions. - Github Issues For bug reports and feature requests. üèó Installation Windows / MacOS Download the binary release for your platform from the latest release page, unzip the package and run the executable.
