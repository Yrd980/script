Keeping your system up to date usually involves invoking multiple package managers. This results in big, non-portable shell one-liners saved in your shell. To remedy this, Topgrade detects which tools you use and runs the appropriate commands to update them. Installation !Packaging statushttps://repology.org/project/topgrade/versions - Arch Linux: AUR - NixOS: Nixpkgs - Void Linux: XBPS - macOS: Homebrew or MacPorts - Windows: Chocolateychoco, Scoopscoop or Wingetwinget - PyPi: pip - Fedora: Copr choco: https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/topgrade scoop: https://scoop.sh//apps?q=topgrade winget: https://winstall.app/apps/topgrade-rs.topgrade Other systems users can either use or the compiled binaries from the release page. The compiled binaries contain a self-upgrading feature. Usage Just run . Configuration See for an example configuration file. Migration and Breaking Changes Whenever there is a breaking change, the major version number will be bumped, and we will document these changes in the release note, please take a look at it when updated to a major release. > Got a question? Feel free to open an issue or discussion! Configuration Path on each platform - Windows: - macOS and other Unix systems: will look for the configuration file in the following places, in order of priority: 1. 2. If the file with higher priority is present, no matter it is valid or not, the other configuration files will be ignored. On the first runno configuration file exists, will create a configuration file at for you. Custom Commands Custom commands can be defined in the config file which can be run before, during, or after the inbuilt commands, as required. By default, the custom commands are run using a new shell according to the environment variable on unix falls back to or on windows falls back to . On unix, if you want to run your command using an interactive shell, for example to source your shell's rc files, you can add at the start of your custom command. But note that this requires the command to exit the shell correctly or else the shell will hang indefinitely. Remote Execution You can specify a key called in the configuration file. This key should contain a list of hostnames that have Topgrade installed on them. Topgrade will use to run on remote hosts before acting locally. To limit the execution only to specific hosts use the parameter. Contribution Problems or missing features? Open a new issue describing your problem and if possible provide a solution. Missing a feature or found an unsupported tool/distro? Just let us now what you are missing by opening an issue. For tools, please open an issue describing the tool, which platforms it supports and if possible, give us an example of its usage. Want to contribute to the code? Just fork the repository and start coding. Contribution Guidelines See CONTRIBUTING.md Roadmap - Add a proper testing framework to the code base. - Add unit tests for package managers. - Split up code into more maintainable parts, eg. putting every linux package manager in a own submodule of linux.rs.
