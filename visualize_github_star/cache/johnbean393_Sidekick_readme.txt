All conversations happen offline, and your data stays secure. Sidekick is a <strong>local first</strong> application –– with a built in inference engine for local models, while accommodating OpenAI compatible APIs for additional model options. !Screenshot Example Use Let’s say you're collecting evidence for a History paper about interactions between Aztecs and Spanish troops, and you’re looking for text about whether the Aztecs used captured Spanish weapons. !Screenshot Here, you can ask Sidekick, “Did the Aztecs use captured Spanish weapons?”, and it responds with direct quotes with page numbers and a brief analysis. !Screenshot To verify Sidekick’s answer, just click on the references displayed below Sidekick’s answer, and the academic paper referenced by Sidekick immediately opens in your viewer. Features Read more about Sidekick's features and how to use them here. Resource Use Sidekick accesses files, folders, and websites from your experts, which can be individually configured to contain resources related to specific areas of interest. Activating an expert allows Sidekick to fetch and reference materials as needed. Because Sidekick uses RAG Retrieval Augmented Generation, you can theoretically put unlimited resources into each expert, and Sidekick will still find information relevant to your request to aid its analysis. For example, a student might create the experts , , , and . In the image below, he has activated the expert . !Screenshot Users can also give Sidekick access to files just by dragging them into the input field. !Screenshot Sidekick can even respond with the latest information using web search, speeding up research. !Screenshot Bring Your Own API Key In addition to its core local-first capabilities, Sidekick now offers an option to bring your own key for OpenAI compatible APIs. This allows you to tap into additional remote models while still preserving a primarily local-first workflow. Reasoning Model Support Sidekick supports a variety of reasoning models, including DeepSeek's DeepSeek-R1 and hybrid reasoning models such as Alibaba Cloud's Qwen3. !Screenshot When using hybrid reasoning models such as Qwen3, reasoning can be toggled on/off. As you type your prompt, Sidekick automatically analyses it and determines if reasoning is needed. To explicitly toggle reasoning, click the button in the prompt bar. Function Calling Sidekick can call functions to boost the mathematical and logical capabilities of models, and to execute actions. Functions are called sequentially in a loop until a result is obtained. For example, when asking Sidekick to reverse a string or do arithmetic operation, it runs tools, then presents the result. !Screenshot When telling Sidekick to draft an invitation email for a birthday celebration to my friend Jean, Sidekick finds my birthday and Jean's email address from my contacts book, and creates a draft in my default email client. !Screenshot This enables agents running fully locally. Deep Research Deep Research is a specific agent implemented in Sidekick to handle long horizon, multi-step research tasks. !Screenshot Specify a research topic, and let Sidekick do the rest –– reading 50-80 webpages, and synthesizing information to prepare a research report. !Screenshot Memory Sidekick can now remember helpful information between conversations, making its responses more relevant and personalized. Whether you're typing, speaking, or generating images in Sidekick, it can recall details and preferences you’ve shared and use them to tailor its responses. The more you use it, the more useful it becomes, and you’ll start to notice improvements over time. For example, I might tell Sidekick that I am a beginner in Python trying to create my own version of Tetris. !Screenshot When I ask it about alternatives, it makes recommendations based on my current project, Tetris. !Screenshot Canvas Create, edit and preview websites, code and other textual content using Canvas. !Screenshot Select parts of the text, then prompt the chatbot to perform selective edits. !Screenshot Image Generation Sidekick can generate images from text, allowing you to create visual aids for your work. There are no buttons, no switches to flick, no mode. Instead, a built-in CoreML model automatically identifies image generation prompts, and generates an image when necessary. !Screenshot Image generation is available on macOS 15.2 or above, and requires Apple Intelligence. Advanced Markdown Rendering Markdown is rendered beautifully in Sidekick. LaTeX Sidekick offers native LaTeX rendering for mathematical equations. !Screenshot !Screenshot Data Visualization Visualizations are automatically generated for tables when appropriate, with a variety of charts available, including bar charts, line charts and pie charts. !Screenshot !Screenshot Charts can be dragged and dropped into third party apps. Code Code is beautifully rendered with syntax highlighting, and can be exported or copied at the click of a button. !Screenshot Toolbox Use Tools in Sidekick to supercharge your workflow. Inline Writing Assistant Press to access Sidekick's inline writing assistant. For example, use the command to do your homework without leaving Microsoft Word! !Screenshot Use the default keyboard shortcut to accept suggestions for the next word, or to accept all suggested words. View a demo here. !Screenshot Detector Use Detector to evaluate the AI percentage of text, and use provided suggestions to rewrite AI content. !Screenshot Diagrammer !Screenshot Diagrammer allows you to swiftly generate intricate relational diagrams all from a prompt. Take advantage of the integrated preview and editor for quick edits. !Screenshot Slide Studio !Screenshot Instead of making a PowerPoint, just write a prompt. Use AI to craft 10-minute presentations in just 5 minutes. !Screenshot Export to common formats like PDF and PowerPoint. !Screenshot Fast Generation Sidekick uses as its inference backend, which is optimized to deliver lightning fast generation speeds on Apple Silicon. It also supports speculative decoding, which can further improve the generation speed. !Screenshot Optionally, you can offload generation to speed up processing while extending the battery life of your MacBook. !Screenshot Installation Requirements - A Mac with Apple Silicon - RAM ≥ 8 GB Download and Setup - Follow the guide here. Goals The main goal of Sidekick is to make open, local, private, and contextually aware AI applications accessible to the masses. Read more about our mission here.
