What does Scoop do? Scoop installs apps from the command line with a minimal amount of friction. It: - Eliminates User Account Control UAC prompt notifications. - Hides the graphical user interface GUI of wizard-style installers. - Prevents polluting the environment variable. Normally, this variable gets cluttered as different apps are installed on the device. - Avoids unexpected side effects from installing and uninstalling apps. - Resolves and installs dependencies automatically. - Performs all the necessary steps to get an app to a working state. Scoop is quite script-friendly. Your environment can become the way you like by using repeatable setups. For example: If you have built software that you would like others to use, Scoop is an alternative to building an installer like MSI or InnoSetup. You just need to compress your app to a file and provide a JSON manifest that describes how to install it. Installation Run the following commands from a regular non-admin PowerShell terminal to install Scoop: Note: The first command makes your device allow running the installation and management scripts. This is necessary because Windows 10 client devices restrict execution of any PowerShell scripts by default. It will install Scoop to its default location: You can find the complete documentation about the installer, including advanced installation configurations, in ScoopInstaller/Install. Please create new issues there if you have questions about the installation. Multi-connection downloads with Scoop can utilize https://github.com/aria2/aria2 to use multi-connection downloads. Simply install through Scoop and it will be used for all downloads afterward. By default, displays a warning when running or while is enabled. This warning can be suppressed by running . You can tweak the following settings with the command: - aria2-enabled default: true - aria2-warning-enabled default: true - aria2-retry-wait default: 2 - aria2-split default: 5 - aria2-max-connection-per-server default: 5 - aria2-min-split-size default: 5M - aria2-options default: Inspiration - Homebrew - Sub What sort of apps can Scoop install? The apps that are most likely to get installed fine with Scoop are those referred to as "portable" apps. These apps are compressed files which can run standalone after being extracted. This type of apps does not produce side effects like changing the Windows Registry or placing files outside the app directory. Scoop also supports installer files and their uninstallation methods. Likewise, it can handle single-file apps and PowerShell scripts. These do not even need to be compressed. See the runat package for an example: it is simply a GitHub gist.
