It can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is edited. Tree-sitter aims to be: - General enough to parse any programming language - Fast enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor - Robust enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors - Dependency-free so that the runtime library which is written in pure C can be embedded in any application Links - Documentation - Rust binding - WASM binding - Command-line interface discord: https://img.shields.io/discord/1063097320771698699?logo=discord&label=discord matrix: https://img.shields.io/matrix/tree-sitter-chat%3Amatrix.org?logo=matrix&label=matrix
