replay.fish > Run Bash commands replaying changes in Fish. 🍤 Let's say you need to run a Bash command, and want Fish to inherit changes in the environment, e.g., exported and unset variables, changes to the , and so on. How do you do that? Caveats? Unfortunately, yes. There's no way to preserve the last command exit status. You'll lose the entire state of your session; history may not sync up correctly if you have Fish running in other terminal tabs, local variables are gone. Fish takes a little while to start up. Moreover, things Fish is configured to do on startup like running configuration snippets or displaying a custom greeting may not be appreciated. If jobs are running in the background, they'll be terminated too. Replay runs your commands in Bash, captures exported variables, aliases, changes, and reproduces them in Fish so you don't have to -away your session. Installation Install with Fisher: Quickstart This sets the environment variable in your session. This will download and install the latest Node release requires https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm. Bash aliases? You got it. Replay will even take care of special variables like , switching directories if needed. > Replay is not bulletproof!
