Open-LLM-VTuber is a unique voice-interactive AI companion that not only supports real-time voice conversations and visual perception but also features a lively Live2D avatar. All functionalities can run completely offline on your computer! You can treat it as your personal AI companion — whether you want a , , , or any other character, it can meet your expectations. The project fully supports , , and , and offers two usage modes: web version and desktop client with special support for transparent background desktop pet mode, allowing the AI companion to accompany you anywhere on your screen. Although the long-term memory feature is temporarily removed coming back soon, thanks to the persistent storage of chat logs, you can always continue your previous unfinished conversations without losing any precious interactive moments. In terms of backend support, we have integrated a rich variety of LLM inference, text-to-speech, and speech recognition solutions. If you want to customize your AI companion, you can refer to the Character Customization Guide to customize your AI companion's appearance and persona. The reason it's called instead of or is because the project's initial development goal was to use open-source solutions that can run offline on platforms other than Windows to recreate the closed-source AI Vtuber . This project underwent code refactoring after version and is currently in active development, with many exciting features coming soon! 🚀 Check out our Roadmap to learn about update plans. 👀 Demo | !assets/i1.jpg | !assets/i2.jpg | |:---:|:---:| | !assets/i3.jpg | !assets/i4.jpg | ✨ Features & Highlights - 🖥️ Cross-platform support: Perfect compatibility with macOS, Linux, and Windows.
