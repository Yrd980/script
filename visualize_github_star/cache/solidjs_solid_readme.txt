Instead of using a Virtual DOM, it compiles its templates to real DOM nodes and updates them with fine-grained reactions. Declare your state and use it throughout your app, and when a piece of state changes, only the code that depends on it will rerun. At a Glance Try this code in our playground! <details> <summary>Explain this!</summary> Solid compiles your JSX down to efficient real DOM updates. It uses the same reactive primitives at runtime but making sure there's as little rerendering as possible. Here's what that looks like in this example: </details> Key Features - Fine-grained updates to the real DOM - Declarative data: model your state as a system with reactive primitives - Render-once mental model: your components are regular JavaScript functions that run once to set up your view - Automatic dependency tracking: accessing your reactive state subscribes to it - Small and fast - Simple: learn a few powerful concepts that can be reused, combined, and built on top of - Provides modern framework features like JSX, fragments, Context, Portals, Suspense, streaming SSR, progressive hydration, Error Boundaries and concurrent rendering. - Naturally debuggable: A is a real div, so you can use your browser's devtools to inspect the rendering - Web component friendly and can author custom elements - Isomorphic: render your components on the client and the server - Universal: write custom renderers to use Solid anywhere - A growing community and ecosystem with active core team support <details> <summary>Quick Start</summary> You can get started with a simple app by running the following in your terminal: Or for TypeScript: This will create a minimal, client-rendered application powered by Vite. Or you can install the dependencies in your own setup. To use Solid with JSX recommended, run: The easiest way to get set up is to add to your , babel config for webpack, or rollup configuration: For TypeScript to work, remember to set your to handle Solid's JSX: </details> Why Solid? Performant Meticulously engineered for performance and with half a decade of research behind it, Solid's performance is almost indistinguishable from optimized vanilla JavaScript See Solid on the JS Framework Benchmark. Solid is small and completely tree-shakable, and fast when rendering on the server, too. Whether you're writing a fully client-rendered SPA or a server-rendered app, your users see it faster than ever. Read more about Solid's performance from the library's creator. Powerful Solid is fully-featured with everything you can expect from a modern framework. Performant state management is built-in with Context and Stores: you don't have to reach for a third party library to manage global state if you don't want to. With Resources, you can use data loaded from the server like any other piece of state and build a responsive UI for it thanks to Suspense and concurrent rendering. And when you're ready to move to the server, Solid has full SSR and serverless support, with streaming and progressive hydration to get to interactive as quickly as possible. Check out our full interactive features walkthrough. Pragmatic Do more with less: use simple, composable primitives without hidden rules and gotchas. In Solid, components are just functions - rendering is determined purely by how your state is used - so you're free to organize your code how you like and you don't have to learn a new rendering system. Solid encourages patterns like declarative code and read-write segregation that help keep your project maintainable, but isn't opinionated enough to get in your way. Productive Solid is built on established tools like JSX and TypeScript and integrates with the Vite ecosystem. Solid's bare-metal, minimal abstractions give you direct access to the DOM, making it easy to use your favorite native JavaScript libraries like D3. And the Solid ecosystem is growing fast, with custom primitives, component libraries, and build-time utilities that let you write Solid code in new ways.

We do not support IE or similar sunset browsers. For server environments, we support Node LTS and the latest Deno and Cloudflare Worker runtimes. <img src="https://saucelabs.github.io/images/opensauce/powered-by-saucelabs-badge-gray.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Testing Powered By SauceLabs" width="300"/> Community Come chat with us on Discord!
