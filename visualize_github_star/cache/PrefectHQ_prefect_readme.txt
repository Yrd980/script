It's the simplest way to elevate a script into a production workflow. With Prefect, you can build resilient, dynamic data pipelines that react to the world around them and recover from unexpected changes. With just a few lines of code, data teams can confidently automate any data process with features such as scheduling, caching, retries, and event-based automations. Workflow activity is tracked and can be monitored with a self-hosted Prefect server instance or managed Prefect Cloud dashboard. > !TIP > Prefect flows can handle retries, dependencies, and even complex branching logic > > Check our docs or see the example below to learn more! Getting started Prefect requires Python 3.9+. To install the latest version of Prefect, run one of the following commands: Then create and run a Python file that uses Prefect and decorators to orchestrate and observe your workflow - in this case, a simple script that fetches the number of GitHub stars from a repository: Fire up a Prefect server and open the UI at http://localhost:4200 to see what happened: To run your workflow on a schedule, turn it into a deployment and schedule it to run every minute by changing the last line of your script to the following: You now have a process running locally that is looking for scheduled deployments! Additionally you can run your workflow manually from the UI or CLI. You can even run deployments in response to events. > !TIP > Where to go next - check out our documentation to learn more about: > - Deploying flows to production environments > - Adding error handling and retries > - Integrating with your existing tools > - Setting up team collaboration features Prefect Cloud Prefect Cloud provides workflow orchestration for the modern data enterprise.
