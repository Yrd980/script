PostCSS <img align="right" width="95" height="95" alt="Philosopher’s stone, logo of PostCSS" src="https://postcss.org/logo.svg"> PostCSS is a tool for transforming styles with JS plugins. These plugins can lint your CSS, support variables and mixins, transpile future CSS syntax, inline images, and more. PostCSS is used by industry leaders including Wikipedia, Twitter, Alibaba, and JetBrains. The Autoprefixer and Stylelint PostCSS plugins are some of the most popular CSS tools. --- <img src="https://cdn.evilmartians.com/badges/logo-no-label.svg" alt="" width="22" height="16" /> Built by <b><a href="https://evilmartians.com/devtools?utmsource=postcss&utmcampaign=devtools-button&utmmedium=github">Evil Martians</a></b>, go-to agency for <b>developer tools</b>. --- Abstract Syntax Tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstractsyntaxtree Evil Martians: https://evilmartians.com/?utmsource=postcss Autoprefixer: https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer Stylelint: https://stylelint.io/ plugins: https://github.com/postcss/postcssplugins Sponsorship PostCSS needs your support.

This API can then be used by plugins to do a lot of useful things, e.g., to find errors automatically, or to insert vendor prefixes. Currently, PostCSS has more than 200 plugins. You can find all of the plugins in the plugins list. Below is a list of our favorite plugins — the best demonstrations of what can be built on top of PostCSS.

All PostCSS runners should pass PostCSS Runner Guidelines. PostCSS Runner Guidelines: https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/main/docs/guidelines/runner.md PostCSS API documentation: https://postcss.org/api/ Options Most PostCSS runners accept two parameters: An array of plugins. An object of options. Common options: : an object providing a syntax parser and a stringifier. : a special syntax parser for example, SCSS. : a special syntax output generator for example, Midas. : source map options. : the input file name most runners set it automatically. : the output file name most runners set it automatically. source map options: https://postcss.org/api/sourcemapoptions Midas: https://github.com/ben-eb/midas SCSS: https://github.com/postcss/postcss-scss Treat Warnings as Errors In some situations it might be helpful to fail the build on any warning from PostCSS or one of its plugins. This guarantees that no warnings go unnoticed, and helps to avoid bugs. While there is no option to enable treating warnings as errors, it can easily be done by adding plugin in the end of PostCSS plugins: Editors & IDE Integration VS Code adds PostCSS support. adds Intellisense for global classes : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=smallcase.postcssense Sublime Text adds PostCSS highlight. : https://github.com/hudochenkov/Syntax-highlighting-for-PostCSS Vim adds PostCSS highlight. : https://github.com/stephenway/postcss.vim WebStorm To get support for PostCSS in WebStorm and other JetBrains IDEs you need to install this pluginjb-plugin. jb-plugin: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8578-postcss Security Contact To report a security vulnerability, please use the Tidelift security contact.
