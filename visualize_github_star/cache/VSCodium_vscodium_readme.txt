If your GNU/Linux distribution has support for snaps: <a id="install-with-package-manager"></a>Install with Package Manager GNU/Linux You can always install using the downloads deb, rpm, tar on the releases page for stable or insiders, but you can also install using your favorite package manager and get automatic updates. @paulcarroty has set up a repository with instructions for , and here. Any issues installing VSCodium using your package manager should be directed to that repository's issue tracker. <a id="install-on-arch-linux"></a>Install on Arch Linux VSCodium is available in AUR, maintained by @binex-dsk as package vscodium-bin stable and as vscodium-insiders-bin. If you want to save disk space by having VSCodium use the Electron system-wide, you also have vscodium-electron, maintained by @m00nw4tch3r. An alternative package vscodium-git, maintained by @cedricroijakkers, is also available should you wish to compile from source yourself. <a id="flatpak"></a>Flatpak Option GNU/Linux VSCodium is available as a Flatpak app here and the build repo is here. If your distribution has support for flatpak, and you have enabled the flathub repo: <a id="build"></a>Build Build instructions can be found here <a id="why"></a>Why Does This Exist This repository contains build files to generate free release binaries of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. When we speak of "free software", we're talking about freedom, not price. Microsoft's releases of Visual Studio Code are licensed under this not-FLOSS license and contain telemetry/tracking. According to this comment from a Visual Studio Code maintainer: > When we Microsoft build Visual Studio Code, we do exactly this. We clone the vscode repository, we lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality telemetry, gallery, logo, etc., and then produce a build that we release under our license. > > When you clone and build from the vscode repo, none of these endpoints are configured in the default product.json. Therefore, you generate a "clean" build, without the Microsoft customizations, which is by default licensed under the MIT license This repo exists so that you don't have to download+build from source. The build scripts in this repo clone Microsoft's vscode repo, run the build commands, and upload the resulting binaries to GitHub releases. These binaries are licensed under the MIT license. Telemetry is disabled. If you want to build from source yourself, head over to Microsoft's vscode repo and follow their instructions. This repo exists to make it easier to get the latest version of MIT-licensed Visual Studio Code. Microsoft's build process which we are running to build the binaries does download additional files. Those packages downloaded during build are: - Pre-built extensions from the GitHub: - ms-vscode.js-debug-companion - ms-vscode.js-debug - ms-vscode.vscode-js-profile-table - From Electron releases using gulp-atom-electron - electron - ffmpeg <a id="more-info"></a>More Info Documentation For more information on getting all the telemetry disabled, tips for migrating from Visual Studio Code to VSCodium and more, have a look at the Docs page page. Troubleshooting If you have any issue, please check the Troubleshooting page or the existing issues. Extensions and the Marketplace According to the Visual Studio Marketplace Terms of Use, you may only install and use Marketplace Offerings with Visual Studio Products and Services. For this reason, VSCodium uses open-vsx.org, an open source registry for Visual Studio Code extensions. See the Extensions + Marketplace section on the Docs page for more details. Please note that some Visual Studio Code extensions have licenses that restrict their use to the official Visual Studio Code builds and therefore do not work with VSCodium. See this note on the Docs page for what's been found so far and possible workarounds. How are the VSCodium binaries built? If you would like to see the commands we run to build into VSCodium binaries, have a look at the workflow files in for Windows, GNU/Linux and macOS. These build files call all the other scripts in the repo. If you find something that doesn't make sense, feel free to ask about it on Gitter. The builds are run every day, but exit early if there isn't a new release from Microsoft. <a id="supported-platforms"></a>Supported Platforms The minimal version is limited by the core component Electron, you may want to check its platform prerequisites. - x macOS , macOS 10.15 or newer x64 - x macOS , macOS 11.0 or newer arm64 - x GNU/Linux x64 , , , , - x GNU/Linux arm64 , , , - x GNU/Linux armhf , , - x GNU/Linux riscv64 - x GNU/Linux loong64 - x GNU/Linux ppc64le - x Windows 10 / Server 2012 R2 or newer x64 - x Windows 10 / Server 2012 R2 or newer arm64 <a id="thanks"></a>Special thanks <table> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/jaredreich" target="blank">@jaredreich</a></td> <td>for the logo</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/PalinuroSec" target="blank">@PalinuroSec</a></td> <td>for CDN and domain name</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://www.macstadium.com" target="blank"><img src="https://images.prismic.io/macstadium/66fbce64-707e-41f3-b547-241908884716MacStadiumLogo.png?w=128&q=75" width="128" height="49" alt="MacStadium logo" /></a></td> <td>for providing a Mac mini M1</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://github.com/daiyam" target="blank">@daiyam</a></td> <td>for macOS certificate</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://signpath.org/" target="blank"><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34448643" height="30" alt="SignPath logo" /></a></td> <td>free code signing on Windows provided by <a href="https://signpath.io/" target="blank">SignPath.io</a>, certificate by <a href="https://signpath.org/" target="blank">SignPath Foundation</a></td> </tr> </table> <a id="license"></a>License MIT
