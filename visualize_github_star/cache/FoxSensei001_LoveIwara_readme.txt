Our goal is to provide users with an excellent experience, supporting multiple platforms and devices including mobile phones, tablets and computers, compatible with Android, Windows and other operating systems. ⚠️ Project Description As a Flutter beginner, this is my first attempt at developing a cross-platform application. While there may be areas in the project that need improvement and code that could be optimized, the main purpose is to learn and understand Flutter development through hands-on practice. - Learning Objectives - Familiarize with Flutter development basics - Understand cross-platform application development processes - Document insights and experiences during the learning process - Project Status - Currently in the learning and exploration phase - Code may not be sufficiently standardized and complete - Feature implementation primarily focuses on learning purposes - Usage Notes - This project is for learning reference only - Not recommended for production environment - Welcome discussions with other learners - Usage Restrictions - Strictly prohibited from promotion on any platform - Violations will result in measures including but not limited to maintenance suspension and repository deletion - Known Issues - Due to limited experience, the project may have room for performance optimization - Some features may not be fully developed - On Android, Impeller rendering has been disabled due to severe performance issues. This might pose a hidden risk for future updates, and the root cause is currently unknown. To re-enable Impeller, you can add within the tag in . If you have insights or solutions, please feel free to submit a PR, open an Issues, or discuss it in the Communication Group. - Suggestions for improvement are welcome Thank you for your understanding and support! If you're also a Flutter beginner, I hope we can progress together in our learning journey. ✨ Features Current Features - 🖥️ Supported Platforms - 📱 Android - 🪟 Windows - 🍎 MacOS Due to lack of Mac device, testing unavailable; - 🐧 Linux Due to lack of Linux device, testing unavailable - 📱 iOS Due to lack of iOS device, testing unavailable - 🌐 Web Development only - 🔍 Search - Search videos/galleries/posts/users/forums - 📜 History - Browsing history: videos/galleries/posts/forums - 📜 Local Favorite - Favorite folder - Local favorite - 🔍 Download Test Version - Download videos/galleries/single files - 🔄 Translation - Translate video descriptions/gallery descriptions/posts/comments/forums/conversations, etc. - 🎥 Video - Video playback - Video tags - Video quality selection - Playback speed control - Fullscreen support - 🖼️ Gallery - Image browsing - Image zoom and pan - Gallery view - 📝 Posts - Browse/comment - 🗣️ Forum System - Publish/edit posts - Publish/edit replies - 📜 Comments - Comment browsing - Comment reply - 📜 Local Favorite - Favorite folder - Local favorite - 📩 Private Messages - Private message browsing - Private message reply - 🔔 In-app Message Notifications - Message notification browsing - Message notification reply - 👤 User System - User authentication - Profile management - Following system - 🔗 Share - Share video/gallery/post/thread/user - Android app jump Only Android, other apps will jump to the app to continue browsing when trying to open the link - 🌍 Multi-language Support - English - Simplified Chinese - Traditional Chinese - Japanese - 🔍 More features to be discovered Upcoming Features - Temporary no new features planned, you can submit your ideas in the Issues or Communication Group - Enhanced User Experience - Others 📱 Communication Group Click here to join the communication group. 📱 Screenshots | | | |:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:| |<img src="docs/imgs/all.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/dingyue.png" width="300">| |<img src="docs/imgs/filter.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/gonggao.png" width="300">| |<img src="docs/imgs/huihua.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/luntan.png" width="300">| |<img src="docs/imgs/luntanxaingqing.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/pinglun.png" width="300">| |<img src="docs/imgs/record.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/shezhi.png" width="300">| |<img src="docs/imgs/shipin.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/shipin2.png" width="300">| |<img src="docs/imgs/shipinliebiao.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/sousuo.png" width="300">| |<img src="docs/imgs/tongzhi.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/tuku.png" width="300">| |<img src="docs/imgs/tukuliebiao.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/zuozhe.png" width="300">| |<img src="docs/imgs/download.png" width="300">|<img src="docs/imgs/localshoucang.png" width="300">| 🛠️ Development Environment Setup Prerequisites - Flutter SDK Latest stable version recommended - Dart SDK - Git - Recommended IDEs: - Android Studio / Cursor - VS Code / Cursor + Flutter plugin - Check the pubspec.yaml for more dependencies.

Android Signing Configuration Before building the Android version, you need to configure the correct signing information to generate the official release APK. Please follow these steps: 1. Generate keystore file Open terminal in the project's directory and execute the following command please replace and other parameters with your own information: This command will generate a file named in the current directory. Please ensure this file is located in the directory. 2. Configure signing information Please check the signing configuration in the file to ensure it's configured as follows: At the same time, ensure the following placeholders are included in the file: This ensures that signing information can be injected through system environment variables, or configured directly with actual values locally recommended only for debugging environments. 3. GitHub Actions Configuration To automatically build signed APKs on GitHub Actions, the following preparations are needed: - Convert the file to a Base64-encoded string, then add a Secret in the repository's Secrets for example, named . - At the same time, add the following entries in the repository Secrets: - your keystore password - alias used for signing - your key password In the workflow file such as , configure environment variables and restore keystore file steps as shown in the following example: 4. Build Command After configuration is complete, execute in the project root directory: After successful build, the generated APK will be located at . After following the above steps for configuration, you can generate and use signed Android APKs for publishing or subsequent overlay installations.
