RouterSploit - Exploitation Framework for Embedded Devices !Python 3.6http://www.python.org/download/ !Build Statushttps://travis-ci.org/threat9/routersploit Community Join community on Embedded Exploitation Discord. Description The RouterSploit Framework is an open-source exploitation framework dedicated to embedded devices. !asciicasthttps://asciinema.org/a/180370 It consists of various modules that aid penetration testing operations: exploits - modules that take advantage of identified vulnerabilities creds - modules designed to test credentials against network services scanners - modules that check if a target is vulnerable to any exploit payloads - modules that are responsible for generating payloads for various architectures and injection points generic - modules that perform generic attacks Installation Requirements Required: requests paramiko pysnmp pycrypto Optional: bluepy - Bluetooth low energy Installation on Kali Linux Bluetooth Low Energy support: Installation on Ubuntu 20.04 Bluetooth Low Energy support: Installation on Ubuntu 18.04 & 17.10 Bluetooth Low Energy support: Installation on OSX Running on Docker To run again without rebuild Update Update RouterSploit Framework often. The project is under heavy development and new modules are shipped almost every day. Build your own To our surprise, people started to fork routersploit not because they were interested in the security of embedded devices but simply because they want to leverage our interactive shell logic and build their tools using similar concept. All these years they must have said: "There must be a better way!" and they were completely right, the better way is called Riposte. Riposte allows you to easily wrap your application inside a tailored interactive shell. Common chores regarding building REPLs was factored out and being taken care of so you can focus on specific domain logic of your application.
