Some popular used models include: - runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting - diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1 - andregn/RealisticVisionV3.0-inpainting - Lykon/dreamshaper-8-inpainting - Sanster/anything-4.0-inpainting - BrushNet - PowerPaintV2 - Sanster/AnyText - Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example - Plugins: - Segment Anything: Accurate and fast Interactive Object Segmentation - RemoveBG: Remove image background or generate masks for foreground objects - Anime Segmentation: Similar to RemoveBG, the model is specifically trained for anime images. - RealESRGAN: Super Resolution - GFPGAN: Face Restoration - RestoreFormer: Face Restoration - FileManager: Browse your pictures conveniently and save them directly to the output directory. Quick Start Start webui IOPaint provides a convenient webui for using the latest AI models to edit your images. You can install and start IOPaint easily by running following command: That's it, you can start using IOPaint by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. All models will be downloaded automatically at startup. If you want to change the download directory, you can add . More documentation can be found here You can see other supported models at here and how to use local sd ckpt/safetensors file at here. Plugins You can specify which plugins to use when starting the service, and you can view the commands to enable plugins by using . More demonstrations of the Plugin can be seen here Batch processing You can also use IOPaint in the command line to batch process images: is the folder containing input images, is the folder containing corresponding mask images. When is a path to a mask file, all images will be processed using this mask. You can see more information about the available models and plugins supported by IOPaint below. Development Install nodejs, then install the frontend dependencies. Create a file in and fill in the backend IP and port. Start front-end development environment Install back-end requirements and start backend service Then you can visit for development. The frontend code will automatically update after being modified, but the backend needs to restart the service after modifying the python code.
