Hyprspace A plugin for Hyprland that implements a workspace overview feature similar to that of KDE Plasma, GNOME and macOS, aimed to provide a efficient way of workspace and window management. > !NOTE > This plugin is still maintained, by combined efforts of me and all the awesome contributors. However, I do not have as much time that I could spend on this plugin as before, and Hyprland is a rapidly changing codebase. Therefore, at this time, I could not guarantee that new issues could be resolved promptly. I appreciate your acknowledgement and support for this project! > > P.S.: I could recommend giving niri a try for anyone who is considering an alternative to Hyprland. It is a scrolling window manager that offers a great built-in overview feature that allows dragging windows in-between workspaces just like this plugin does. It also has better workspace management as it cleans up empty workspaces like GNOME does. https://github.com/KZDKM/Hyprspace/assets/41317840/ed1a585a-30d5-4a79-a6da-8cc0713828f9 Jump to installation Plugin Compatibility - x hyprsplit tested, explicit support - x split-monitor-workspaces tested, explicit support - x hyprexpo tested, minor bugs - x Any layout plugin except ones that override Hyprland's workspace management Roadmap - x Overview interface - x Workspace minimap - x Workspace display - Mouse controls - x Moving window between workspaces - x Creating new workspaces - Dragging windows between workspace views - Configurability - Styling - x Panel background - x Workspace background & border - x Panel on Bottom - Vertical layout on left / right - x Panel top padding reserved for bar / notch - x Panel border color / thickness - Unique styling for special workspaces - x Behavior - x Autodrag windows - x Autoscroll workspaces - x Responsive workspace switching - x Responsive exiting - x Exit on click / switch - x Exit with escape key - x Blacklisting workspaces - x Show / hide new workspace and empty workspaces - x Show / hide special workspace 11 - x Animation support - x Multi-monitor support tested - x Monitor scaling support tested - x aarch64 support No function hook used - x Touchpad & gesture support - x Workspace swipe 9 - x Scrolling through workspace panel - x Swipe to open Installation Manual To build, have hyprland headers installed and under the repo directory do: Then use followed by the absolute path to the file to load, you could add this to your to load the plugin on startup Hyprpm Nix Refer to the Hyprland wiki on plugins, but your flake might look like this: Usage Opening Overview - Bind the or perform a workspace swipe vertically would open / close the panel.
