The tldr-pages project is a collection of community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, that aims to be a simpler, more approachable complement to traditional man pages. Maybe you're new to the command-line world. Perhaps you're just a little rusty or can't always recall the arguments for commands like , or ? It certainly doesn't help that, in the past, the first option explained in was: There is room for simpler help pages focused on practical examples.

How do I use it? > !TIP > For browsing without installing a client on your computer, > see the web client at <https://tldr.inbrowser.app> with offline support using PWA. A popular and convenient way to access these pages on your computer is to install the official Python client, which can be installed via pip3 or other package managers: Linux and Mac users can also install the official Rust Client using Homebrew or other package managers on other operating systems: Alternatively, you can also use the official Node.js client, although it has fallen behind in updates: Then you have direct access to simplified, easy-to-read help for commands, such as , accessible through typing instead of the standard .
