Concept &nbsp; About Quarkdown is a modern Markdown-based typesetting system, designed around the key concept of versatility, by seamlessly compiling a project into a print-ready book or an interactive presentation. All through an incredibly powerful Turing-complete extension of Markdown, ensuring your ideas flow automatically into paper. &nbsp; <p align="center"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgio/quarkdown/project-files/images/paged-demo.png" alt="Paper demo"> <p align="center"><em>Original credits: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762v7">Attention Is All You Need</a></em></p> </p> <br> Born as an extension of CommonMark and GFM, the Quarkdown Flavor brings functions to Markdown, along with many other syntax extensions. <br> > This is a function call: > <br> Possibilities are unlimited thanks to an ever-expanding standard library, which offers layout builders, I/O, math, conditional statements and loops. Not enough? You can still define your own functions and variables — all within Markdown. You can even create awesome libraries for everyone to use. <br> > > Result: Hello, world from iamgio! <br> This out-of-the-box scripting support opens doors to complex and dynamic content that would be otherwise impossible to achieve with vanilla Markdown. Combined with live preview and :zap: fast compilation speed, Quarkdown simply gets the work done. &nbsp; <p align="center"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgio/quarkdown/project-files/video/livepreview.gif" alt="Live preview" /> </p> &nbsp; Check the wiki to learn more about the language and its features. &nbsp; --- <h2 align="center">Check out the demo presentation <a href="https://iamgio.eu/quarkdown/demo" target="blank">here</a></h3> <p align="center"> Built with Quarkdown itself — <a href="demo/demo.qd" target="blank"><strong>source code</strong></a> <br><br> <em>Desktop view is suggested</em> </p> --- &nbsp; As simple as you expect... <p align="center"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgio/quarkdown/project-files/images/code-paper.png" alt="Paper code demo"> <p align="center"><em>Inspired by: <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/x-ray-flashes-nearby-supermassive-black-hole-accelerate-mysteriously-0113">X-ray flashes from a nearby supermassive black hole accelerate mysteriously</a></em></p> </p> &nbsp; <h2 align="right">...as complex as you need.</h2> <p align="center"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgio/quarkdown/project-files/images/code-chart.png" alt="Chart code demo"> </p> Targets - HTML - :whitecheckmark: Plain output default - :whitecheckmark: Slides <sup>via reveal.js</sup> - :whitecheckmark: Paged books, articles <sup>via paged.js</sup> Paged documents require a webserver to render in the browser.

If missing, Java 17, Node.js and npm will be installed automatically using the system's package manager unless is used. Manual installation Download from the latest stable release or build it with , and unzip it. Optionally, adding it to your allows you to access Quarkdown more easily. Requirements: - Java 17 or higher - Only for PDF export Node.js, npm, Puppeteer. See PDF export for details. &nbsp; Creating a project Running will launch the prompt-based project wizard, making it quicker than ever to set up a new Quarkdown project, with all metadata and initial content already present. For more information about the project creator, check out its wiki page. Alternatively, you may manually create a source file and start from there. &nbsp; Compiling Running will compile the given file and save the output to file. > If the project is composed by multiple source files, the target file must be the root one, i.e. the one that includes the other files. > > - How to include other files? If you would like to familiarize yourself with Quarkdown instead, lets you play with an interactive REPL mode. Options - or : enables automatic content reloading after compiling. If a webserver is not running yet, it is started and the document is opened in the default browser. This is required in order to render paged documents in the browser. - or : recompiles the source everytime a file from the source directory is changed. > !TIP > Combine to achieve live preview! - : produces a PDF file. Learn more in the wiki's PDF export page. - or : sets the directory of the output files. Defaults to . - : sets the name of the output resource to be saved inside the output directory. Defaults to the name of the document, set via https://github.com/iamgio/quarkdown/wiki/document-metadata. Note: special characters will be replaced with dashes in the actual file name. - or : sets the directory where external libraries can be loaded from. Defaults to . ? - or : sets the target renderer. Defaults to . Accepted values: - - equivalent to - : optional customization of the local webserver's port. Defaults to . - : produces pretty output code. This is useful for debugging or to read the output code more easily, but it should be disabled in production as the results might be visually affected. - : deletes the content of the output directory before producing new files. Destructive operation. - : forces the program to exit if an error occurs. When not in strict mode, errors are shown as boxes in the document. - : turns the media storage system off. ? - : makes generated subdocument file names collision-proof. ? - JVM property: sets the log level. If set to or higher, the output content is not printed out. &nbsp; --- &nbsp; Mock document &nbsp; <p align="center"> <img width="550" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamgio/quarkdown/project-files/images/mock-demo.png" alt="Mock document demo"> </p> Mock, written in Quarkdown, is a comprehensive collection of visual elements offered by the language, making it ideal for exploring and understanding its key features — all while playing and experimenting hands-on with a concrete outcome in the form of pages or slides. - The document's source files are available in the mock directory, and can be compiled via . - The PDF artifacts generated for all possible theme combinations are available and can be viewed in the https://github.com/iamgio/quarkdown/tree/generated/pdf/mock branch.

This is, indeed, the concept Quarkdown is built upon.
