Documentation Full product documentation WIKI Issue tracker Building from sources Architecture - DBeaver is written on Java. - Basic frameworks: - OSGI platform for plugins and dependency management. Community version consists of 130+ plugins. - Eclipse RCP platform for rich user interface build. - JDBC for basic database connectivity API. - JSQLParser and Antlr4 for SQL grammar and semantic parser. - For networking and additional functionality we use wide range of open source libraries such as SSHJ, JSch, Okhttp, OpenAI SDK, Apache POI, JFreeChart, JTS/GIS, etc. - We separate model plugins from desktop UI plugins. This allows us to use the same set of "back-end" plugins in both DBeaver and CloudBeaver. - Dependencies: being an OSGI application we use P2 repositories for third party dependencies. For additional Maven dependencies we use our own DBeaver P2 repo.
