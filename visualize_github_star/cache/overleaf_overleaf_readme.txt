We run a hosted version at www.overleaf.com, but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf. > !CAUTION > Overleaf Community Edition is intended for use in environments where all users are trusted. Community Edition is not appropriate for scenarios where isolation of users is required due to Sandbox Compiles not being available. When not using Sandboxed Compiles, users have full read and write access to the container resources filesystem, network, environment variables when running LaTeX compiles. For more information on Sandbox Compiles check out our documentation. Enterprise If you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf in your lab or workplace, we offer an officially supported version called Overleaf Server Pro. It also includes more features for security SSO with LDAP or SAML, administration and collaboration e.g. tracked changes. Find out more! Keeping up to date Sign up to the mailing list to get updates on Overleaf releases and development. Installation We have detailed installation instructions in the Overleaf Toolkit. Upgrading If you are upgrading from a previous version of Overleaf, please see the Release Notes section on the Wiki for all of the versions between your current version and the version you are upgrading to. Overleaf Docker Image This repo contains two dockerfiles, server-ce/Dockerfile-base, which builds the image, and server-ce/Dockerfile which builds the or "community" image. The Base image generally contains the basic dependencies like , plus . We split this out because it's a pretty heavy set of dependencies, and it's nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time. The image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code and services. Use and from to build these images. We use the Phusion base-image which is extended by our image to provide us with a VM-like container in which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the service manager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the folder.
