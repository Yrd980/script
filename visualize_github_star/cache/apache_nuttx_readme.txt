Scalable from 8-bit to 64-bit microcontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are POSIX and ANSI standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOSs such as VxWorks are adopted for functionality not available under these standards, or for functionality that is not appropriate for deeply-embedded environments such as fork. For brevity, many parts of the documentation will refer to Apache NuttX as simply NuttX. Getting Started First time on NuttX? Read the Getting Started guide! If you don't have a board available, NuttX has its own simulator that you can run on terminal. Documentation You can find the current NuttX documentation on the Documentation Page. Alternatively, you can build the documentation yourself by following the Documentation Build Instructions. The old NuttX documentation is still available in the Apache wiki. Supported Boards NuttX supports a wide variety of platforms. See the full list on the Supported Platforms page.
