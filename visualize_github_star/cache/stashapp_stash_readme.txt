Stash supports a wide variety of both video and image formats. You can tag videos and find them later. Stash provides statistics about performers, tags, studios and more. You can watch a SFW demo video to see it in action. For further information you can consult the documentation or read the in-app manual.

First Run Windows/macOS Users: Security Prompt On Windows or macOS, running the app might present a security prompt since the binary isn't yet signed. On Windows, bypass this by clicking "more info" and then the "run anyway" button. On macOS, Control+Click the app, click "Open", and then "Open" again. FFmpeg Stash requires FFmpeg. If you don't have it installed, Stash will download a copy for you. It is recommended that Linux users install from their distro's package manager. Usage Quickstart Guide Stash is a web-based application. Once the application is running, the interface is available by default from http://localhost:9999. On first run, Stash will prompt you for some configuration options and media directories to index, called "Scanning" in Stash. After scanning, your media will be available for browsing, curating, editing, and tagging. Stash can pull metadata performers, tags, descriptions, studios, and more directly from many sites through the use of scrapers, which integrate directly into Stash. Identifying an entire collection will typically require a mix of multiple sources: - The project maintains StashDB, a crowd-sourced repository of scene, studio, and performer information. Connecting it to Stash will allow you to automatically identify much of a typical media collection. It runs on our stash-box software and is primarily focused on mainstream digital scenes and studios. Instructions, invite codes, and more can be found in this guide to Accessing StashDB. - Several community-managed stash-box databases can also be connected to Stash in a similar manner. Each one serves a slightly different niche and follows their own methodology. A rundown of each stash-box, their differences, and the information you need to sign up can be found in this guide to Accessing Stash-Boxes. - Many community-maintained scrapers can also be downloaded, installed, and updated from within Stash, allowing you to pull data from a wide range of other websites and databases. They can be found by navigating to Settings -> Metadata Providers -> Available Scrapers -> Community stable. These can be trickier to use than a stash-box because every scraper works a little differently. For more information, please visit the CommunityScrapers repository. - All of the above methods of scraping data into Stash are also covered in more detail in our Guide to Scraping. <sub>StashDB is the canonical instance of our open source metadata API, stash-box.</sub> Translation !Translatehttps://translate.codeberg.org/engage/stash/ Stash is available in 32 languages so far! and it could be in your language too.
