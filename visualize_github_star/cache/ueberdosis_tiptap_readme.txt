Tiptap is based on the highly reliable ProseMirror library. Tiptap Editor is complemented by the collaboration open-source backend Hocuspocus. Both the Editor and Hocuspocus form the foundation of the Tiptap Suite. !Build Statushttps://github.com/ueberdosis/tiptap/actions/workflows/build.yml !Versionhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@tiptap/core !Downloadshttps://npmcharts.com/compare/@tiptap/core?minimal=true !Licensehttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@tiptap/core !Chathttps://discord.gg/WtJ49jGshW !Sponsorhttps://github.com/sponsors/ueberdosis How does the Tiptap Editor work? - Headless Framework: Tiptap does not rely on a user interface.
