Clone the repository 2. Install dependenciesrequires 3. Start the application Docker Alternatively, you can use Docker requires CUDA 12.4 and NVIDIA Driver version >550, see Docker docs: APIs VideoLingo supports OpenAI-Like API format and various TTS interfaces: - LLM: , , , , ... sorted by performance, be cautious with gemini-2.5-flash... - WhisperX: Run whisperX large-v3 locally or use 302.ai API - TTS: , , , , , , You can modify your own TTS in customtts.py! > Note: VideoLingo works with 302.ai - one API key for all services LLM, WhisperX, TTS. Or run locally with Ollama and Edge-TTS for free, no API needed! For detailed installation, API configuration, and batch mode instructions, please refer to the documentation: English | 中文 Current Limitations 1. WhisperX transcription performance may be affected by video background noise, as it uses wav2vac model for alignment. For videos with loud background music, please enable Voice Separation Enhancement. Additionally, subtitles ending with numbers or special characters may be truncated early due to wav2vac's inability to map numeric characters e.g., "1" to their spoken form "one". 2. Using weaker models can lead to errors during processes due to strict JSON format requirements for responses tried my best to prompt llm😊. If this error occurs, please delete the folder and retry with a different LLM, otherwise repeated execution will read the previous erroneous response causing the same error. 3. The dubbing feature may not be 100% perfect due to differences in speech rates and intonation between languages, as well as the impact of the translation step. However, this project has implemented extensive engineering processing for speech rates to ensure the best possible dubbing results. 4. Multilingual video transcription recognition will only retain the main language. This is because whisperX uses a specialized model for a single language when forcibly aligning word-level subtitles, and will delete unrecognized languages. 5. For now, cannot dub multiple characters separately, as whisperX's speaker distinction capability is not sufficiently reliable. 📄 License This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
