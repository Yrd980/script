TODO - x Reading order based on the model - x Recognition of and in the main text - x Table recognition - x Heading Classification - x Handwritten Text Recognition - x Vertical Text Recognition - x Latin Accent Mark Recognition - Code block recognition in the main text - Chemical formula recognition - Geometric shape recognition Known Issues - Reading order is determined by the model based on the spatial distribution of readable content, and may be out of order in some areas under extremely complex layouts. - Limited support for vertical text. - Tables of contents and lists are recognized through rules, and some uncommon list formats may not be recognized. - Code blocks are not yet supported in the layout model. - Comic books, art albums, primary school textbooks, and exercises cannot be parsed well. - Table recognition may result in row/column recognition errors in complex tables. - OCR recognition may produce inaccurate characters in PDFs of lesser-known languages e.g., diacritical marks in Latin script, easily confused characters in Arabic script. - Some formulas may not render correctly in Markdown. FAQ - If you encounter any issues during usage, you can first check the FAQ for solutions. - If your issue remains unresolved, you may also use DeepWiki to interact with an AI assistant, which can address most common problems. - If you still cannot resolve the issue, you are welcome to join our community via Discord or WeChat to discuss with other users and developers.

However, since YOLO follows the AGPL license, it may impose restrictions on certain use cases. In future iterations, we plan to explore and replace these with models under more permissive licenses to enhance user-friendliness and flexibility.
