Windows/MacOS/RasPi/Android/Other builds see below. - Always built with the latest stable version of Chromium. - Intended to behave like and have the featureset of Google Chrome, with differences/patches/enhancements listed below. - Includes Widevine, All Codecs, Chrome Plugins, as well as thinLTO, CFlag, LDFlag, LLVM Loop, and PGO compiler optimizations. It is built with SSE4, AVX, and AES, so it won't launch on CPU's below 2nd gen Core or AMD FX, but benefits from Advanced Vector EXtensions. If your CPU lacks AVX, you can use builds from the Thorium SSE3 repo.

These are also included in the Windows releases, but it doesn't make a shorcut, although a .png and .ico is in the install directory for you to make your own shortcut with an icon. You can also run contentshell with the command thorium-shell custom wrapper for it, located in /usr/bin/. You can run ChromeDriver at /usr/bin/chromedriver or chromedriver.exe on Windows. Also, patches for abseil library and miniinstaller when building with AVX on Windows. > - Right clicking the launcher after install gives three additional desktop actions, one to open thorium-shell, another to open in Safe Mode which disables any flags one has set in chrome://flags until the next launch, and lastly to open in Dark Mode which appends the --force-dark-mode flag. - For more info, read the PATCHES.md file. - Known bugs are in the BUGS.md file. - A list of Chromium command line flags can be found at > https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches Building <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/buildlight.svggh-dark-mode-only"> <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/NEW/builddark.svggh-light-mode-only"> See > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/docs/BUILDING.md Debugging <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/STAGING/bug.svg" width="28"> See > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/tree/main/infra/DEBUGreadme ------- &nbsp;&minus; https://www.reddit.com/r/ChromiumBrowser/ is a subreddit I made for Thorium and general Thorium/Chromium discussion, https://thorium.rocks/ is the website I made for it, and https://alex313031.blogspot.com/ is a blog I made relating to Thorium/ThoriumOS. \ &nbsp;&minus; I also build ChromiumOS now called ThoriumOS with Thorium, Codecs, Widevine, linux-firmware/modules, and extra packages at > https://github.com/Alex313031/ChromiumOS/ &nbsp;&minus; Thanks to https://github.com/robrich999/ for some info and fixes that went into this project.\ &nbsp;&minus; Thanks to https://github.com/midzer/ for support and helping with builds. \ &nbsp;&minus; Also thanks to https://github.com/bromite/bromite, https://github.com/saiarcot895/chromium-ubuntu-build, https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium, https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium, and https://github.com/iridium-browser/iridium-browser for patch code. \ &nbsp;&minus; The paksrc dir, and the binaries in packsrc/bin are credited to @freeer https://github.com/myfreeer/chrome-pak-customizer/ &nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: libpepflashplayer.so is included for posterity and can be used to enable Adobe Flash on older Chromium releases. ʘ‿ʘ Thanks for using Thorium! <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/STAGING/Thorium90504.jpg" width="200"> <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/STAGING/GitHub/GitHub-Mark-Light-32px.pnggh-dark-mode-only"> <img src="https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/logos/STAGING/GitHub/GitHub-Mark-32px.pnggh-light-mode-only">
