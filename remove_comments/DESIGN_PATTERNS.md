# Design Patterns in Comment Removal Script

## Overview
The comment removal script has been refactored using several design patterns to improve maintainability, extensibility, and adherence to SOLID principles.

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Strategy Pattern
**Purpose**: Encapsulate different comment removal algorithms and make them interchangeable.

**Implementation**:
- `CommentStrategy` (Abstract Base Class)
- `SingleLineCommentStrategy` - Handles `//`, `#`, `--` comments
- `MultiLineCommentStrategy` - Handles `/* */`, `{- -}`, `--[[ ]]` comments
- `CompositeCommentStrategy` - Combines multiple strategies

**Benefits**:
- Easy to add new comment types
- Each strategy is focused on one type of comment
- Strategies can be combined flexibly

### 2. Factory Pattern
**Purpose**: Centralize the creation of comment removal strategies.

**Implementation**:
- `CommentRemoverFactory` - Manages strategy registration and retrieval
- Static registry of strategies by file extension
- Provides clean interface for getting appropriate strategy

**Benefits**:
- Encapsulates strategy creation logic
- Easy to register new language support
- Centralized strategy management

### 3. Template Method Pattern
**Purpose**: Define the skeleton of comment removal algorithm while allowing subclasses to override specific steps.

**Implementation**:
- `LanguageCommentRemover` - Template class that uses strategy
- `CommentStrategy.remove_comments()` - Abstract method defining the algorithm
- Concrete strategies implement the specific removal logic

**Benefits**:
- Consistent interface across all strategies
- Easy to extend with new languages
- Clear separation of concerns

### 4. Composite Pattern
**Purpose**: Treat individual strategies and groups of strategies uniformly.

**Implementation**:
- `CompositeCommentStrategy` - Combines multiple strategies
- Can contain both individual strategies and other composites
- Applies strategies in sequence

**Benefits**:
- Handles complex languages with multiple comment types
- Maintains single interface for all strategies
- Flexible composition of strategies

### 5. Command Pattern
**Purpose**: Encapsulate file processing as an object.

**Implementation**:
- `FileProcessor` - Encapsulates file processing logic
- `execute()` method performs the processing
- Can be easily extended with undo/redo functionality

**Benefits**:
- Encapsulates file operations
- Easy to add logging, validation, or error handling
- Supports future extensions like batch processing

### 6. Orchestrator Pattern
**Purpose**: Coordinate complex operations involving multiple components.

**Implementation**:
- `CommentRemovalOrchestrator` - Coordinates the entire process
- Manages strategy setup and file processing
- Provides clean interface for the main function

**Benefits**:
- Centralized coordination
- Easy to modify the overall process
- Clear separation between setup and execution

## SOLID Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each strategy handles only one type of comment
- `FileProcessor` only handles file operations
- `CommentRemoverFactory` only manages strategy creation

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- New comment types can be added without modifying existing code
- New languages can be supported by adding new strategies
- Extensions are made through inheritance and composition

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All strategies can be used interchangeably
- `CompositeCommentStrategy` can be used anywhere a `CommentStrategy` is expected

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- `CommentStrategy` interface is focused and minimal
- No client is forced to depend on methods it doesn't use

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions (`CommentStrategy`)
- Low-level modules implement these abstractions
- Dependencies are injected rather than hard-coded

## Benefits of the Refactored Design

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced coupling between components

### Extensibility
- Adding new languages requires minimal changes
- New comment types can be easily added
- Strategies can be combined in new ways

### Testability
- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Mock strategies can be easily created
- Clear interfaces make testing straightforward

### Reusability
- Strategies can be reused across different contexts
- Factory pattern allows easy strategy sharing
- Composite pattern enables flexible strategy combinations

## Usage Example

```python
# Create orchestrator
orchestrator = CommentRemovalOrchestrator()

# Process files
patterns = ['**/*.java', '**/*.py', '**/*.js']
results = orchestrator.process_files(patterns)

# Add new language support
new_strategy = CompositeCommentStrategy([
    SingleLineCommentStrategy('//'),
    MultiLineCommentStrategy('/*', '*/')
], ['.newlang'])
CommentRemoverFactory.register_strategy('.newlang', new_strategy)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Observer Pattern**: Add logging and progress tracking
2. **Builder Pattern**: Create complex strategy configurations
3. **Chain of Responsibility**: Handle file processing errors
4. **Memento Pattern**: Support undo/redo operations
5. **State Pattern**: Handle different processing states
